<blockquote>
<p>A common misperception is that we must start with firm requirements. There is a widespread but fallacious view that requirements are the customersâ€™ job and that development should not start until they are explicitly defined. The fact is that the demand for firm and unchanging requirements is mostly wishful thinking&#8230;. </p>
