<h3 id="structure">Structure</h3>
<p>Before diving into the ideas themselves, let me say a few words about the overall structure of the work. </p>

<p>The bulk of the work consists of 52 <em>Big Ideas</em>. </p>

<p>These are divided into the following sections. </p><table>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:left;">
 Title </th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
 Description </th>
 </tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
 <a href="fundamental.xhtml" class="wiki-link">Fundamental</a> </td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
 Ideas applicable to all phases and all roles</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
 <a href="leadership.xhtml" class="wiki-link">Leadership</a> </td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
 Ideas primarily of interest to those in any sort of leadership role </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
 <a href="people.xhtml" class="wiki-link">People</a> </td>
<td style="text-align:left;">

</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
 <a href="initiation.xhtml" class="wiki-link">Initiation</a> </td>
<td style="text-align:left;">

</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
 <a href="execution.xhtml" class="wiki-link">Execution</a> </td>
<td style="text-align:left;">

<td style="text-align:left;">
 <a href="caution.xhtml" class="wiki-link">Caution</a> </td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
 A few things to watch out for </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Following the presentation of the ideas, the next section contains <a href="pagan-tuna-posts.xhtml" class="wiki-link">Pagan Tuna Posts</a>. These are short pieces that go into detail on one topic or another, and are referenced from the appropriate <em>Big Idea(s)</em>. These were originally published on a blog written by the same author,  appearing at PaganTuna.com. Consult these as interests and needs dictate. </p>

<p>The <a href="reference.xhtml" class="wiki-link">Reference</a> section contains info about the author, a glossary and a colophon. </p>

<p>This is followed by a <a href="navigation.xhtml" class="wiki-link">Navigation</a> section, which offers a number of ways in which the reader may navigate directly to a particular topic of interest. </p>

<p>The final secion is the <a href="bibliography.xhtml" class="wiki-link">Bibliography</a>, which is quite extensive, and so is placed at the very end of the work so as not to obscure other content by virtue of its sheer bulk. </p>
