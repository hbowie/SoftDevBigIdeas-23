<blockquote>
<p>For years, app dev pros have been told to keep their heads down &#8211; that all you need to do is follow the project plan and write your code. Wrong. Lift your head up, find your passion, understand the business and then use your technical creativity to make beautiful applications that users find useful, usable, and desirable. </p>
