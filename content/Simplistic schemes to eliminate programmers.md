Body:

Over the years, executives have backed their desire to eliminate programmers with staggering funds. Dozens of simplistic schemes have been heaped with money and praise on the promise — as yet not kept — of going directly from a sales proposal to a working data-processing system. Their touching faith in the magic of technology should serve as inspiration to those of us who daily bend our backs to the programmer’s burden. Perhaps their wishes — though they can surely never be fulfilled — should give us pause — make us lift our noses from the coding pad or the terminal — and consider this human activity of ours from a human point of view.
