Before diving into the ideas themselves, let me say a few words about the overall structure of the work. 

The bulk of the work consists of 52 *Big Ideas*.

These are divided into the following sections:

| Title | Description |
| :---- | :---------- |
| [[Intro]] | Introductory materials, to help orient the reader
| [[Fundamental]] | Ideas applicable to all phases and all roles
| [[Leadership]] | Ideas primarily of interest to those in any sort of leadership role 
| [[People]] | Ideas that help with human issues 
| [[Initiation]] | Things to consider when starting a new project 
| [[Execution]] | Ideas to apply while executing a project 
| [[Caution]] | A few things to watch out for 


Following the presentation of the ideas, the next section contains [[Pagan Tuna Posts]]. These are short pieces that go into detail on one topic or another, and are referenced from the appropriate *Big Idea(s)*. These were originally published on a blog written by the same author,  appearing at PaganTuna.com. Consult these as interests and needs dictate.

The [[Reference]] section contains info about the author, a glossary and a colophon. 

This is followed by a [[Navigation]] section, which offers a number of ways in which the reader may navigate directly to a particular topic of interest. 

The final secion is the [[Bibliography]], which is quite extensive, and so is placed at the very end of the work so as not to obscure other content by virtue of its sheer bulk.
