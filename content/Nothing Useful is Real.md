Body:

...you said you think you know some things. What you mean is, you've constructed simplified representations of how those things work. But don't confuse yourself by thinking your simplified mental constructions are realistic, or worse yet, true ... Nothing useful is real. If it's complicated enough to be realistic, it's too complicated to be useful. That's why we build models. Representations. When we say we know things, we just mean we have mental models of those things that we like. Often we like them because they've been useful. But let's not confuse having a useful model with actual knowing. 

Managers have a problem ... when they fall in love with a particular model of how something works. When they become convinced that a mental model they have of how something works is the right one. When they decide that they know something. ... when we become too wedded to a model, we lose our ability to deal with new situations.
