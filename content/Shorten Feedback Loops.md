Body:

As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Mulally" class="reflink" target="ref">Alan Mulally</a> said to his team, when leading development of the Boeing 777 airliner:

The feedback loops we are shortening can also be thought of as learning loops. Each loop should consist of [[Plan-Do-Check-Act]] steps.

Such loops can provide feedback on the product being built, or on the process being used. In Agile, process feedback is considered during a [retrospective](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/iteration-retrospective/), while product feedback is considered as part of a <a href="http://agileforall.com/how-to-give-a-great-sprint-demo/" class="reflink" target="ref">software demo</a>.

In waterfall style development, it can take the entire length of your project to obtain feedback on your product and your processes.

Agile, on the other hand, states as its third [[Principles of Agile Software Development|principle]]:

> Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

This practice of [[Delivering Early and Often]] allows for frequent, iterative learning about customer requirements and preferences, product successes and shortcomings, as well as processes, tools and methods.

When developing a new piece of software, the best way to shorten your feedback loop is to focus your initial efforts on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product" class="reflink" target="ref">Minimum Viable Product</a> (MVP).

When considering feedback loops, we must be careful to make a distinction between meaningful feedback and the other kind.

Meaningful feedback on a software development project might include evaluation of results from the following activities:

* developer reports on the progress of a task, and any problems encountered;
* build of an entire system, including new code recently added;
* execution of code;
* completion of a suite of validation tests;
* demonstration of working software;
* disposition (approval or rejection) of working software by a customer;
* usage of a system by representative users attempting to perform some common tasks;
* results from completion of a coding effort, in terms of items completed; vs. items planned, and actual schedule vs. planned schedule;
* actual usage of software by real users for real tasks.

I call these items meaningful because they all should produce fairly clear and unambiguous results.

Practices such as continuous build integration, automated testing, software prototyping, daily stand-up meetings, and short rapid delivery cycles are all ways to shorten loops that produce meaningful feedback.

The other sort of feedback frequently sought on development projects comes from reviews of documents by management, management delegates, and/or professed experts. Before attempting to defend the significance of such reviews, you may wish to consider this text from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman" class="reflink" target="ref">Daniel Kahneman</a>&#8217;s 2011 book <cite>[[Thinking, Fast and Slow]]</cite>:

Kahneman goes on to point out that:

So take results from these sorts of reviews with a grain of salt. You may get some enlightening feedback that will prove helpful, but you are just as likely to get confusing direction that can lead you down the garden path.
