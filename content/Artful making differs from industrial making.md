Artful making differs from what we call industrial making. The principles of industrial making are so embedded in business thinking that they’re transparent and we don’t notice them. But, as we shall see, industrial methods can distort reality and smother innovation. Artful and industrial making are distinct approaches and each must be applied in the appropriate conditions.
