The [Wikipedia article on Entrepreneurial Leadership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurial_leadership) defines the attributes of an entrepreneurial leader in this way:

> The entrepreneurial leader will work within a formalized organizational structure, but use the approaches normally expected of an entrepreneur to identify opportunities to gain advantage. They also have the ability to then manage change to deliver that advantage. Key to this is the effective management of risk rather than the minimization of risk often sought within corporate environments. The entrepreneurial leader must have the ability to learn fast and within environments of ambiguity and change, while providing clarity and coherence for those around them.

Software development projects almost always require entrepreneurial leadership because, by nature, they are developing something new, involve significant degrees of risk and uncertainty, and must learn quickly within environments of ambiguity and change.

[[Peter Block]], in <cite>[[The Empowered Manager: Positive Political Skills at Work]]</cite>, describes two different paths of leadership.

The Bureaucratic Path is characterized by:

* Maintenance
* Caution
* Dependency

On the other hand, the Entrepreneurial Path requires:

* Greatness
* Courage
* Autonomy

Let's look at each of these three areas in more detail.

* **Greatness** vs. Maintenance: Steve Jobs used the phrase "insanely great" to describe Apple products. By taking the path of greatness, a leader sets a high bar for his development team, as well as providing them with a strong sense of purpose. For more on this topic, see the Pagan Tuna post &#8220;[[Thinking Differently about Perfectionism]].&#8221;

* **Courage** vs. Caution: Developing a new software product always involves some significant level of risk. A leader should certainly not be foolhardy, but neither should his goal be to avoid all risk, for in so doing he is not likely to achieve anything of lasting value.

* **Autonomy** vs. Dependency: A software development team and its leader should be able to make most important decisions without constantly having to go back to a Program Management Office or a project Steering Committee for direction.

Note that for a leader to exercise these three traits -- Greatness, Courage and Autonomy -- he or she must be willing to engage meaningfully with the development team, and not just stay comfortably above the fray.

[[Morgan and Liker]] describe the leader's role this way, in their book the book <cite>[[The Toyota Product Development System: Integrating People, Process and Technology]]</cite>:

[[Michael Lopp]] says something similar in his book *[[Managing Humans: Biting and Humorous Tales of a Software Engineering Manager]]*:

And, in his extensive [[The Shape of Things to Come|article about Jony Ive]] in <a href="http://www.newyorker.com" class="reflink" target="ref">The New Yorker</a>, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/ian-parker" class="reflink" target="ref">Ian Parker</a> makes this observation about Apple's chief design officer:
