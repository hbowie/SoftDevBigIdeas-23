Body:

*The Big Ideas in Software Development* is a *book*, in the sense that it is:

+ a written work,
+ of significant length,
+ focused on a particular topic, 
+ of some enduring interest and relevance,
+ organized into the usual parts found in a book.

However, unlike most books, this one is meant to take full advantage of the open web, and so is not offered exclusively, or even primarily, in the traditional printed form. 

The book is authored using Markdown and Notenik, and all of the source files can be found on GitHub, at:

+ [hbowie/SoftDevBigIdeas-23](https://github.com/hbowie/SoftDevBigIdeas-23)

So, if you are using a Mac, the first way to read the book is to install Notenik, download the repository on GitHub, then open the `content` folder within Notenik. There is no cost for either the app or the book's content, and Notenik is designed to make usage of the book in this form easy and pleasurable. 

However, for most readers, the most convenient means of access will be to point their web browsers at [SoftDevBigIdeas.com](https://www.softdevbigideas.com).
