Body:

Make sure you have a well-defined <a href="http://www.scaledagileframework.com/vision/" class="reflink" target="ref">vision</a> to start with. What is your product's value proposition? What are the key benefits to be delivered to stakeholders? What is the overall scope of your effort?  Are there certain critical dates you must hit, in order to achieve benefits realization? What are the key product attributes necessary to deliver the benefits being pursued? How is this product different from others already available, or known to be in development?

Your vision should be succinct enough to be easily read in a single sitting, but should be concrete enough to provide real guidance to the project team about what moves you towards the goal line vs. what moves you away from it, or simply leaves you running from one edge of the field to the other.

Once you have a draft vision, interview key stakeholders individually and ask them what the project vision means to them. Make sure you receive consistent answers. If you don't, then you need to get the group back together to iron out inconsistencies and sharpen your vision.

The product vision need not be fancy, but it should be documented. Without some sort of overall vision for the product and its evolution, the project can too easily devolve into a simple aggregation of unrelated change requests, and the product can quickly become a victim of feature bloat, and suffer from [scope creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_creep). A product vision provides the [[Cohesion]] necessary to make both the project team and the features being implemented more than just the sums of their respective parts.

As you are defining your vision, consider its implications. There will likely be elements that will need to be considered in other areas as you prepare to start your development project.

Although your product vision should be concise, it should be specific and meaningful. Avoid the sort of trap Bob Lewis warns you about when it comes to Mission Statements:

The Product Vision is similar in many respects to the Chief Engineer's Concept Paper used at Toyota, and described by [[Morgan and Liker]] in their book <cite>[[The Toyota Product Development System: Integrating People, Process and Technology]]</cite>.
