Body:

Software development can be viewed as a series of decisions to be made.

As you consider this stream of decisions on your project, it's important to keep a few things in mind.

1. Do you know what decisions have been made, and which ones are still waiting for a decision? It's good to maintain an [[Understand the Arc of Your Project|explicit list of these]].

2. Do you know which are the "big" decisions: the ones with the farthest-reaching and most significant consequences? You don't want to make these decisions lightly, but neither do you want to continually sweep them under the rug.

3. Are decisions being made at a reasonable pace? It may help to think of your software development process as a [[What engineering has in common with manufacturing and why it matters|decision factory]], and then look for places where the flow of decisions is being impeded.

4. Are you making decisions at "[[Implementing Lean Software Development: From Concept to Cash|the last responsible moment]]"? There may be a point at which a particular decision needs to be made in order to keep the project moving forward, and to delay the decision beyond that point would be irresponsible. But if more information, analysis and/or experimentation would help the team make a better decision, then it may be better to wait for that additional input before rendering judgment.

5. Is your decision-making process open to diverse inputs, and willing to honestly reconsider its decisions when presented with new information? Are team members encouraged to openly share their views, and encouraged to take risks when presenting opinions that might prove to be unpopular? Is your team willing to openly confront conflicting viewpoints, in order to reach the best decisions possible?
