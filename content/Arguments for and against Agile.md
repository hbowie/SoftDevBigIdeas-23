Body:

Real-world examples argue both for and against agile methods. Responding to change is a critical success factor in many time-critical projects and was cited as a driver in the Netscape-Microsoft browser wars. On the other hand, over-responding to change was one of the identified causes for the $3 billion overrun of the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration's Advanced Automation System for national air traffic control. We believe that common sense dictates the evaluation of both approaches for incorporation within the project manager's technical and managerial toolbox.
