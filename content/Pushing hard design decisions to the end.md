Body:

In too many programming organizations, every time thereâ€™s a design debate, nobody ever manages to make a decision, usually for political reasons. So the programmers only work on uncontroversial stuff. As time goes on, all the hard decisions are pushed to the end. *These projects are the most likely to fail.*
