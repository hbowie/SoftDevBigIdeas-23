Body:

In the spring of '23 I made some significant improvements to the site. 

The content itself changed very little, but I've improved the overall organization, appearance and usability, and made some navigational enhancements. 

Also, where I had been sometimes referencing my own content at PaganTuna.com, I've now pulled those referenced posts into a separate section at the back of this work. 

Perhaps my favorite improvement is the new ability to consult one of the 52 big ideas from the [[Random Idea]] page; I can envision this being used in a somewhat oracular fashion, much as one might [consult the I Ching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching_divination); or, in perhaps a less fanciful vision, as something to be exercised as part of a weekly staff meeting. 

However you choose to use this content, though, I hope that these changes will make the site easier and more enjoyable to use.
