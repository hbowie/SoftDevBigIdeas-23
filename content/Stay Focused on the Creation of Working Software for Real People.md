Body:

This was a major message of the Agile movement, which opened its [[Manifesto for Agile Software Development|Manifesto]] with the words: "We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it."

To a great extent, this was a reaction to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_Maturity_Model" class="reflink" target="ref">Capability Maturity Model</a> era, in which the actual act of software coding was often overshadowed by achievement of maturity levels, implementation of key process areas, documentation of processes, generation of artifacts and tallying of metrics.

As noted in the SEI paper, "[[CMMI or Agile: Why Not Embrace Both!]]":

The point here is that well-intentioned improvement efforts, whether initiated by management or by consultants, can all too easily prove a distraction to the actual production of working software to be used by real people, often to the detriment of everyone involved.

In particular, you would do well to avoid any sort of zealotry concerning any particular model being peddled by management consultants: while most such models can be useful, all are imperfect representations of reality, and most tend to take on a life of their own after a certain period of time. For more on this topic, see the Pagan Tuna post, &ldquo;[[Model Mania]].&rdquo;

It would be wise to pay heed to the advice on this subject from <cite>[[Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview]]</cite>:

{:include-quote-body:The magic is not in the process}

It's ok to learn from the various software development gurus and movements you will find around you, but it's best not to declare absolute allegiance to any of them. Remember that many consultants, speakers and authors are primarily interested in creating reliable revenue streams, and that their interests will not always coincide with yours. Also, I've worked with teams devoted to the [CMMI][] as well as teams devoted to [Agile][] and, in both cases, I've found mindless conformance to a set of precepts to be more harmful than any of the practices either of these movements was intended to correct.
