        content: "I have been practicing software development for more than four decades now and over that time in addition to writing a lot of code and being part of numerous projects in varying capacities I ve done a fair amount of reading on the topic In fact I have shelves full of books on the subject starting with classics like <cite> The Mythical Man Month Essays on Software Engineering < cite> proceeding through the CMM period and then on into the Lean Agile years And of course the number of new words written on the topic increases daily How can a software developer keep up I m a firm believer that new ideas are generated from time to time and that it is worthwhile to read about software development as well as to do it on the other hand I m now at the point of wondering whether it wouldn t be possible to communicate the most important ideas about the field in a simpler more concise more easily accessible fashion And so I am setting off to test my hypothesis by trying to document The Big Ideas in Software Development in a concrete manageable sequential list Some of these ideas are specific to software development but many have broader application my primary intent is to include ideas that I ve found most helpful over the years and that I would want to recommend to others working in the field This book describes ideas and not specific practices Practices are important but my experience has been that even the best practices can be misapplied and produce poor results if leaders and developers lack a solid understanding of these ideas and so I ve tried to focus on the ideas behind the practices Many of these ideas overlap and reinforce each other but hopefully each adds something new and important to the collection as a whole I ve included liberal citations from many of my favorite authors and works In some cases I ve incorporated these into my text and commented on them but in others I ve simply left them at the bottom of a relevant page for readers to enjoy trusting that their pertinence to the ideas at hand will prove to be easily discernible I ve collected the sources of these citations into a generous Bibliography that can be found towards the back of this work I should warn readers up front that those who align themselves with a particular methodology or movement such as Lean Agile or Waterfall may well be disappointed by some of what they find here My own strong sense is that we ve reached a point in the evolution of our thinking where these sorts of labels do more harm than good and that it is time to rally around a set of shared ideas because they make sense and because they have generally been found to work without regard to what sort of branding they have been associated with in the past My intended audience for this work includes both those relatively new to the field of software development as well as those who have been practicing this trade for many years For the former I hope it may provide a concise introduction to some of these ideas and for the latter I hope it may provide a useful reminder In both cases my intent is to offer a fairly complete concise and balanced list of the ideas that bear careful consideration in any software development effort Although I think anyone involved in software development in any role can benefit from the ideas contained in this work they are undoubtedly most important for anyone involved in some sort of leadership or consulting role architect lead developer project manager line manager department manager customer manager coach program office representative and so on And while many of these ideas can be useful to any developer working on any sort of project they will probably be most helpful for those involved in projects and project teams of some size Software development is one of the riskiest human activities yet conceived projects are often late or over budget frequently canceled and in many cases fail to find an appreciative audience even when they do reach a state of completion Nothing I offer in this work can guarantee the success of your next effort but I do think that sincere and thoughtful consideration of the ideas presented here can increase your chances of success In any case though I d be happy to hear your feedback on the site Correspondence may be directed to author softdevbigideas com mailto author softdevbigideas com About the Author|Herb Bowie Seattle Washington <br > August 2016 Words from Others on this Topic include quote Great minds discuss ideas include quote The Enormous Extension of our Being include quote No single silver bullet to exorcise our software demons"

        content: "We humans often feel a tendency to portray ourselves as knowledgable competent and masterful especially when our work is being observed and judged by others However there are situations in which we are none of these and feigning certainty in these situations is not likely to lead to positive outcomes Dan Snowden s Cynefin framework https en wikipedia org wiki Cynefin framework offers a useful guide to differing approaches that are appropriate for situations with varying degrees of certainty <p><a href= http cognitive edge com target= ref ><img alt= Cynefin Model src= images cynefin model png >< a>< p> The Cynefin framework suggests four different approaches starting with situations of high certainty and proceeding to situations with progressively lower degrees of certainty In Simple situations the appropriate approach is to Sense Categorize and then Respond making use of an established best practice In Complicated situations the appropriate approach is to Sense Analyze and then Respond making use of expert knowledge In Complex situations the recommended approach is to Probe Sense and then Respond allowing new knowledge to emerge In Chaotic situations the appropriate approach is to Act Sense and then Respond learning and adjusting as you go Another way to think about these four categories would be to use the following terms Mechanical In the simplest of situations a mechanical or proceduralized response is most appropriate For example a user requests the addition of a new field to an existing screen in an established application Usually only a brief discussion is required to determine which field type is to be added to the database and which sort of user interface widget is to be added to the screen Analytical In more complicated situations some serious analysis is required Let s say we want to add some new functionality to an existing system to help a user track a package after an order has been placed Various questions naturally arise What sort of information should be presented to the user In what form a textual display or a map And when should the information be provided only when the user requests it or at other times as well This is more than simply a case of plopping the request into one of a few predefined categories Experimental In complex situations analysis based on existing knowledge is not enough and some experimentation is called for Let s say your design team comes up with two very different user interfaces to accomplish a new task Which of them will be preferable to most users In a case like this it s appropriate to build a prototype of some sort and perform some usability testing to allow new knowledge to emerge Crisis In crisis mode something unexpected has happened and there is no opportunity for analysis or experimentation immediate action is necessary For example your new system has been deployed for a week and then suddenly crashes for no obvious reason In a situation like this clearly someone needs to take charge and begin taking action without the luxury of waiting for much analysis or experimentation From a Knowledge Management https en wikipedia org wiki Knowledge management perspective it is useful to think about gradually moving particular situations down this scale towards greater degrees of certainty Once past an immediate crisis then experimentation may be used and once the results of experiments are known then expert knowledge may be built and once all possibilities have been categorized then procedures may be written or perhaps even automated to deal with similar situations in the future On software development projects it is critically important for everyone but especially leaders to acknowledge a legitimate spectrum of uncertainty and to be able to draw from a palette of differing approaches to deal with these varying situations When considering the application of the Cynefin framework to software development it is important to remember a few salient points Simple mechanical tasks should generally be automated or codified by standards and procedures and so your developers should not be spending a lot of time in the simple mechanical corner of the diagram Any project worth doing will be attempting at least some things that have not been done before at least by this particular team and so there will be some things in the complex experimental quadrant In practice it is often difficult to discern the difference between complicated and complex between situations requiring experimentation vs situations in which analysis is sufficient This idea of acknowledging uncertainty has far reaching implications and should be kept in mind when considering the following big ideas as well Uncertainty partially accounts for the The Inconvenient Nature of Software Development The balance between analysis and experimentation is one more dimension along which Software Development is a Balancing Act The ideas to Automate Repetitive Tasks is another reason why your development team should be spending little time performing simple mechanical tasks When you Use Things Already Known to Work this is one way to minimize the amount of complex experimental work your team has to contend with Show Rather than Tell is one way to validate the success of your analysis Plan Do Check Act is a structured means of implementing the Probe Sense Respond approach to experimentation When you Shorten Feedback Loops you help to validate that you ve done sufficient experimentation When you Understand the Arc of Your Project it s important to have a sense of how much complex work requiring experimentation is still in front of you and to get that behind you as early as possible The need to manage uncertainty is another reason why Entrepreneurial Leadership is needed for software development"

        content: "Software development is often viewed from two completely different mindsets Let s consider first the assumptions made by what we might call The Predictive Planning Model 1 Software development is best managed as a set of projects with each project starting and ending at specific points in time 2 There exists a finite set of requirements for any software development project 3 That finite set of requirements is discoverable within some reasonable period of time 4 That set of requirements can be accurately documented and validated before any working software is produced or executed 5 Requirements are most usefully considered in a pure state untainted by any traces of design 6 The clearest way to communicate requirements is through written documents containing some combination of text and diagrams 7 Requirements can be reliably validated through careful review of this documentation 8 Customers can be relied upon to accurately identify the relative priorities of their requirements 9 It is possible to define a repeatable process for requirements discovery based on the principles above 10 The goal of design is to satisfy all the requirements 11 It is very expensive and risky to change software once it is coded and working so it is critical to get the requirements and the design right before coding is allowed to begin 12 At some point in the project early enough to be useful for purposes of planning and governance the amounts of time and effort that will be required to complete the project can be accurately estimated 13 As with other engineering disciplines software engineering is based on a stable foundation of immutable laws 14 It is possible to accurately gauge the overall progress of a project by collating and summarizing progress data from project team members 15 Projects based on these principles will tend to produce satisfied customers These principles sound reasonable don t they What s more they cohere nicely coming together to form a picture of software development that seems pleasingly rational and predictable Wouldn t it be nice if they were actually true However many view software development from a completely different mindset Let s call this one The Adaptive Model 1 Useful software products evolve rapidly and more or less continuously so defining a project as a series of development activities with definite start and end dates is typically somewhat arbitrary and often misleading 2 Software requirements are a matter of opinion and are therefore subjective largely unbounded always incomplete and open to perpetual redefinition and reinterpretation 3 Requirements documents for software development efforts of any significant size are generally difficult to understand and interpret consistently and so offer an entirely misleading sense of control over the software coding activities to follow 4 The supposed boundaries between requirements design and coding are entirely porous with all three phases of development interacting with and influencing the others 5 Prioritizing requirements is generally difficult since every requirement is important to someone and no one wants to call another s child ugly 6 The cost of making software changes has consistently declined due to the increasing power and sophistication of the languages and tools available to modern developers And so writing software and then changing it based on reactions from stakeholders is often more efficient than going through elaborate and unreliable paper based rituals prior to coding 7 Any software development effort is either a journey of discovery or a waste of resources Either you are creating something new or you are recreating something that s already been done If you are creating something new then you had best be honest that you aren t entirely sure what you re doing or how long it will take until you ve done it If you re entirely sure of what you re going to do and when you re going to do it then you re not developing something you re just putting a fresh coat of paint on something that already existed 8 All software applications are built on top of hardware and software platforms that are themselves highly complex and still rapidly evolving There are no limitations There are no hard and fast rules Everything is malleable and everything is possible In this sort of environment it is folly to try to define some sort of repeatable and stable engineering discipline 9 The demonstration of working software is the only reliable indicator of progress in any sort of software development activity All other avowals of project progress are illusory 10 Customers are happiest when the software is adaptive and evolving quickly in response to their explicit and implicit wants and needs Quite a different perspective isn t it Reality The Predictive Planning Model is the one usually favored by leadership because it portrays the act of writing software as a more or less trivial activity that can be easily and effectively managed from on high The Adaptive Model on the other hand is the one usually favored by developers because it generally takes those annoying managers out of the picture and allows the developers to do what they do best without any pesky cost or schedule constraints So which of these is true Well the inconvenient truth is that they both are to varying degrees As I ll argue shortly Software Development is a Balancing Act Although it would be nice to believe that the Predictive Planning Model can be made to work and although it has worked for some to some degree under very special conditions it cannot be really said to be true in general Like Newtonian physics it can sometimes give us a useful approximation of reality but we will get ourselves in trouble if we rely on it to be absolutely valid under all conditions The Adaptive Model is generally much more realistic until we run up against the problems of limited time money and resources because no organization that I ve ever seen can really live with a development team that is constantly adapting to emergent conditions without being willing to give some reasonably reliable predictions of when it will be done meeting some important goal and at what cost So where does that leave us If we are now left with the uncomfortable feeling that we have two different models both of which can be helpful at times but neither of which can be absolutely relied upon then we are probably in the right place to begin thoughtful and appreciative consideration of Software Development s other Big Ideas

        content: "All software development involves trade offs This is equally true whether we re talking about development processes or software products Trying to adhere to absolutes or to maximize one quality or performance factor while ignoring others will generally require you to pretend that these trade offs don t exist and sticking your head in this sort of sand is never a good idea Some of these trade offs may be thought of as polarities A polarity is most simply defined as a complex problem that has no solution It might also be stated as an either or question that has no single right answer A more complete definition might be A set of two opposing or contradictory extremes permitting wide variation along a spectrum of choices with both opposing poles offering advantages and disadvantages The pros and cons of a polarity are often represented in the form of a polarity map in which each quadrant represents the pros or cons of one pole or another as in the following example The flowing arrows are meant to represent the ongoing dynamic process of seeking the optimal balance point at which the pros are maximized and the cons are minimized Sample Polarity Map images polarity map jpg If you are facing a polarity then you will want to engage in Polarity Management https www polaritypartnerships com rather than trying to pick one pole or the other Polarity Examples Let s look at some examples of what I mean 1 Requirements Detail Alan M Davis describes this polarity in his book <cite> Just Enough Requirements Management Where Software Development Meets Marketing < cite> include quote body Just Enough Attention to Requirements Suzanne and James Robertson <a href= http www infoq com articles mastering requirements process class= reflink target= ref >speak to the same polarity< a> in their book <cite> Mastering the Requirements Process < cite> through use of animal analogies include quote body Rabbit Projects vs Elephant Projects 2 Agility vs Discipline In their book <cite> Balancing Agility and Discipline A Guide for the Perplexed < cite> Barry Boehm and Richard Turner frame this polarity using the following examples include quote body Arguments for and against Agile 3 Project Size Large projects can address more ambitious work statements and in theory can optimize their use of resources to deliver the most benefit for the least cost Smaller projects on the other hand carry a higher probability of successful completion and can deliver benefits in a more timely fashion According to a report from The Standish Group include quote body Failures of Large Projects At the same time breaking a large project into smaller chunks often introduces some inefficiencies and so may tend to drive up overall costs and durations 4 Team Empowerment vs Direction from Above Teams that are overly constrained by their leadership are not likely to get much accomplished On the other hand teams that are given free rein to do whatever they think important may fail to meet objectives important to the organization as a whole 5 Pleasing the Customer If a team doesn t please their primary customers then they will not get very far On the other hand if they focus exclusively on pleasing their primary customers then they may fail to meet governance and compliance requirements imposed on their projects by other stakeholders and may overlook opportunities for breakthrough innovation 6 Invention vs Reuse Reuse of existing software can reduce costs but can also put limits on a team s ability to innovate 7 Urgency vs Careful Deliberation Measuring twice before cutting once may reduce the potential for errors and rework but delivering usable results quickly may meet pressing business needs more expeditiously than a long deliberative development cycle 8 Predictive Accuracy vs Speed of Execution Doing careful estimates and refining them as you proceed will maximize your chances of performing to your plan On the other hand Just Do It may be more appropriate for efforts that need to complete quickly even if their costs are higher than anticipated 9 Achievement of Strategic Goals vs Tactical Objectives Long term strategic visions can offer compelling sweeping changes but achievement of short term tactical objectives can often be done at lower cost and risk and with more timely and reliable delivery of benefits 10 High Level vs Low Level Languages Higher level languages such as Java often offer greater programmer productivity On the other hand low level languages such as C can sometimes offer improved software execution speed Implications Each of these polarities requires a project s leadership to strike a balance that maximizes the advantages for their particular project and minimizes the disadvantages All of these decisions involve trade offs There are no perfect answers If you can approach polarities with this understanding then you have a decent chance of coming up with reasonable answers that will allow your project to succeed On the other hand if you insist on making some of these poles sacred cows that can t be questioned then your project is likely to run into problems Balancing these polarities appropriately requires judgment Such judgment is usually best wielded by an individual or a small group of like minded leaders who work well together Since an absolute principle often sounds intuitively more appealing than a balanced middle ground larger groups and those less well acquainted with project details may have a harder time making these sorts of finely calibrated judgments For this reason in my experience it is hard for projects to receive much of this sort of help from those working in executive leadership or governance or oversight roles or from committees of any kind I have also found that traditional risk management often fails to help achieve appropriate balance on any of these polarities since risk mitigation efforts often simply serve as rationalizations for staying the current course on the project rather than making any true course corrections by re balancing any of these polarities While Barry Goldwater may have famously said that extremism in defense of liberty is no vice I am strongly suggesting that extremism in defense of any of these poles on a software development project is very likely to be a vice This is not to say that it s best to always proceed down the middle of the road but that it s best to always have an informed open minded approach to achieving appropriate balance of all these polarities in light of the characteristics of a particular project Software development is difficult enough under the best of circumstances Turning any of these poles into absolute principles to be defended as fundamental articles of faith is likely to burden your software development project with more problems than it can handle boehm turner 2003 bibliography html boehm turner 2003 davis 2005 bibliography html davis 2005 robertson 1999

then proceeding with it if it s not an immediate disaster is not an example of plan do check act Let s review some important success factors for each step of this cycle Plan You must decide where you are using tried and true elements and where you want to innovate For each significant innovation you will want to use some form of this PDCA process For each area of innovation you must allow enough time to conduct one or more experiments and learn from each and this must happen early enough to allow the learnings to be incorporated into the rest of the project Note that this step requires the project leaders to admit that they don t already know everything and further note that many organizational environments view such an admission as a sign of weakness or inadequacy and thus discourage this process from ever getting started As part of the plan step it is important to formulate a testable hypothesis that can be proven or disproven Note that the plan do check act cycle can be used to Consider Alternatives Do You must test in such a way that you can clearly see how well your plan is working As Wernher von Braun famed rocket scientist once said include quote body One Test Result Check Did you achieve the results you were hoping for Be honest about what worked and what didn t Act If a test was successful then you can incorporate the planned approach into your effort and

        content: "Software development has traditionally been thought of as proceeding through a series of phases This is sometimes described as a <a href= https en wikipedia org wiki Systems development life cycle class= reflink target= ref >Systems Development Life Cycle< a> SDLC and is often managed via a series of <a href= https en wikipedia org wiki Phase E2 80 93gate model class= reflink target= ref >gates< a> that control progress from one phase to another ensuring that the work of one phase has been completed successfully before allowing work on the next phase to start A fairly typical list of phases might be as follows 1 Initiation 2 Requirements 3 Design 4 Construction 5 Testing 6 Implementation 7 Maintenance <a href= https en wikipedia org wiki Agile software development class= reflink target= ref >Agile< a> approaches on the other hand tend to break a project down into a series of time boxed sprints or iterations overlapping and compressing phases 2 6 Requirements through Implementation within each iteration If there is any acknowledgment of a larger project lifecycle it often consists merely of an initial iteration referred to as iteration 0 dedicated briefly to startup tasks before beginning the actual work of coding in iteration 1 In my experience both of these approaches tend to have problems The SDLC approach often tries to adhere too rigidly to firm gates and often tends towards micromanagement in its review of deliverables needed to pass through each gate losing sight of the forest in its minute review of the trees Watts Humphrey noted this first problem in trying to establish a firm conclusion to the requirements phase include quote Starting with firm requirements The Agile approach on the other hand often suffers because it assumes too blithely that all problems can be worked out during development iterations with little up front analysis and design work As a result I ve heard frustrated executives declare that Agile is just a way of producing crap faster Unfortunately many software development shops tend to cycle back and forth between these two approaches favoring one or the other based on whichever one most recently yielded disappointing results And a series of project failures based on both approaches often leaves in its wake two teams of firmly entrenched methodology advocates endlessly battling over which of their approaches represents the truth and the light Models that try to get the best of both worlds are now commonly referred to as scaled agile Two such examples are Dean Leffingwell s <a href= http www scaledagileframework com class= reflink target= ref >Scaled Agile Framework< a> SAFe and Scott Ambler s Disciplined Agile Delivery https en wikipedia org wiki Disciplined agile delivery DAD model All of these scaled agile approaches have something to offer and can help an organization move beyond the endless Agile vs Traditional debates For more on this topic see the Pagan Tuna post Benefits of the Scaled Agile Framework However something important often gets lost in all of these attempts to reduce the reality of software development into the artificial confines of one model or another the overall arc of your project What do I mean by this phrase Instead of a software development project let s think for a minute about something else that has a beginning a middle and an end Let s think about a book length work of fiction a novel We can think of each chapter of a novel as comparable to an iteration in an agile development project each chapter delivers some additional dialogue some additional characterization and some additional elements of the plot just as each iteration delivers some working software And each chapter is roughly the same length as the others just as each development iteration is often time boxed into a prescribed length However even though most of us wouldn t consciously mark the progress of a novel from one phase into another we all have an instinctive understanding that a book is not an unending series of chapters that as the story unfolds we are proceeding along a narrative arc that should eventually bring us to a satisfying conclusion And if that arc is interrupted or perverted as it was very intentionally in Hitchcock s movie Psycho for example then we feel that something is wrong we may even be shocked without the need to resort to a particular model of narrative fiction in order to reach that conclusion Now even though we don t consciously think about these narrative stages as we re reading a novel and even though authors don t always consciously consider them as they re writing one we can construct various models of how a story typically proceeds There are for example the twelve stages of a <a href= https en wikipedia org wiki Hero 27s journey class= reflink target= ref >hero s journey< a> as identified by Joseph Campbell Or we could look at the <a href= http www storyboardthat com articles e five act structure class= reflink target= ref >five act structure< a> used explicitly in many plays For our purposes today though let s just consider the simplest of these the <a href= https en wikipedia org wiki Three act structure class= reflink target= ref >three act structure< a> Act I Used for exposition to establish the main characters their relationships the worlds they live in and finally the problem to be solved Act II Our hero wrestles with the problem encountering setbacks along the way and gradually discovers new resources to help address the central problem Act III The problem is resolved Let s return now to consideration of the nature of a software development project If we think broadly about the structure of any such project I will submit that we can typically discern three distinct acts even though they will typically overlap and not be clearly delineated 1 Discover In the first phase a project team is discovering all they can about the problem space and about potential elements of a solution Questions are mostly open ended and you are working to get the general lay of the land 2 Drive to Decisions At this point the team has developed a good sense of what is expected of them and their interests narrow to focus on some fairly specific concerns Typically these involve ambiguities in the problem space competing perspectives held by different stakeholders or difficult design trade offs Resolving these issues generally requires some tough decisions to be made 3 Deliver Finally when they get those open issues nailed down the team knows with some precision what they need to do and they marshal the troops to go off and deliver on the promises made to their customers Note that working software can be developed and delivered in all three of these acts although the purposes of this development will be somewhat different for each in line with the varying characterizations given above Note also that this three act structure may be repeated within the larger arc of a sizable project if delivery of overall project objectives has been decomposed into a series of somewhat smaller efforts just as it is repeated in fiction within a trilogy How does this three act structure for software development help us First we should note that the key mindsets necessary to succeed are very different in these three acts If I may be allowed to use some canine analogies The Discover act primarily requires boundless curiosity much the same thing my Golden Retriever exhibits when he is let off his leash in a new space You need to run around in all directions at once discovering and testing boundaries sniffing anything that might be interesting In the Drive to Decisions act though you need to be more focused and persistent doing whatever it takes to resolve your significant remaining issues In this phase you are more like a bloodhound relentlessly following the scent of its quarry In the Deliver act you need to be efficient and steady in making progress towards the finish line You have lots of stuff to do you know what it is and you need to go about doing it At this point what you need is a sheepdog rounding up the flock and bringing them home at day s end making sure that no straggler gets lost Next we can note that many project failures are traceable back to a problem of giving too much or too little attention to one or more of these acts Some projects get stuck in perpetual Discovery mode wandering around for months and even years without ever figuring out what it is they re supposed to do Some projects skip the Drive to Decisions phase sweeping all the difficult decisions under the rug in the vain hope that they will somehow sort themselves out later As Joel Spolsky has noted include quote Pushing hard design decisions to the end And then there are the projects that try to go straight to the Deliver act in a misguided effort to complete faster Once you begin to develop a sense of what these three acts look like and how they work then it becomes easier to detect and correct project narratives that are deviating from what is likely to be a successful arc Although it should perhaps be noted that it may be easier for an About the Author|English major to apply this wisdom than it is for someone trained in traditional project management disciplines One document that can help a project navigate through these three acts successfully is a list of questions or open issues I m not talking about issues in a project management sense since these are typically viewed as things that are threatening the normal progression of the project I m just talking about the normal list of questions that typically arise during any development project This is typically a document that would be used by a development team or an analyst or an architect or a team lead not by a project manager and would not be managed with any degree of formality or management oversight And I m not suggesting that this list need replace any of a project s other documents often the answers to all these questions will ultimately get recorded in other documents that may be of a more permanent nature Here is how such a list would be used in each of these three acts Discover At the beginning of this act you won t yet know enough to even formulate such a list but should have the goal of being able to start such a list By the end of this act you should have a fairly comprehensive and specific list of open questions that need answers Drive to Decisions As you try to answer the questions you have listed you will come up with some answers as well as some further questions Record the answers which can also be characterized as decisions that have been made as well as the additional questions and move the answered questions down into a lower section of the list In some cases developing some quick software prototypes to show your customers may be the best way to get solid answers to some of your questions You may also want to make note of the reasons for particular decisions When you ve got a long list of answered questions and only minor issues left to be resolved and the pace of adding additional questions has slowed or stopped you re at the end of Act II Deliver Now start or continue the steady delivery of working software based on the answers you ve come up with As additional questions arise don t panic or try to sweep them under the rug just continue to add them to the list and get answers to them Similarly if the answers to some questions change just make sure everyone is in agreement with the new answer record it and proceed to deliver If we focus on the details of a project then we will often see subplots red herrings surprises suspense and mystery just as we do in any good novel After all any software development project is fundamentally a journey of discovery our intent is always to discover the big things early on and have fewer and smaller surprises as we continue but any omniscience we can claim is only in hindsight If we re trying to track progress according to a traditional project plan then the project may appear to be in a state of chaos If we step back and look at the overall arc of the project though proceeding through the three acts of Discover Drive to Decisions and Deliver then we can often get a much better sense of whether a project is fundamentally on track or headed off the road and into the weeds And a list of open questions paired with a list of closed questions and their answers can help key leaders navigate the roiling waters of any challenging project ultimately leading their teams and stakeholders to a successful conclusion Words from Others on this Topic include quote Decision Time vs Execution Time"

commonplace in business to take the work of teams for granted but passive acceptance doesn t always translate into active support Let me break my opening assertion down and explain the significance of each of its components A Small Team I mean something in the range of 3 15 members Such a team if organized well has the following advantages Diversity of knowledge abilities and perspectives Joint decision making following joint discussion and consideration of alternatives Bonding and cohesion of team members including reinforcement of shared team norms Social motivations for completing important work Direct communication between team members What s magic about the size Less than three and you have a duet rather than a group it s more about the individuals and their relationship and less about a team identity More than fifteen and it s hard to maintain direct communication between team members And fifteen by the way is an upper limit for some sorts of teams that may be too large a number And note that the ideas of Decomposition Cohesion and Loose Coupling should be employed in order to break down larger groups into these sorts of teams and to break down larger problems into ones small enough to be assigned to these sorts of teams Multi Skilled For the sort of team I m talking about it s important for the team to be relatively self sufficient which means that all or most of the skills important to the team need to be available within the team This is different from the oboe section within an orchestra or a <a href= http gunsandburgers com wp content uploads 2015 04 Steno pool in office 1959 Seattle Municipal Archives CC BY 2 0 1200x400 gif class= reflink target= ref >steno pool< a> or any sort of pool of resources sharing similar skills A multi skilled team is empowered to act as a collective A group of people with similar skills will not achieve the sorts of benefits I ve listed above for a small team Note that a multi skilled team is also often referred to as a cross functional team https en wikipedia org wiki Cross functional team With Effective Leadership A team can be self organizing but it cannot generally be self governing Some leadership can be internal to the team and some of it can come from outside the team but Govern Wisely|effective leadership is generally required in order for a team to be consistently productive The product development team needs its Steve Jobs The jazz band needs its Miles Davis Ineffective leadership comes in several common forms It can be too passive It can be too self absorbed ignoring signals from the team itself from its customers or from its partners It can be too diffuse consisting of too many leaders from different functions and or levels who are not in alignment with each other Certainly one of the important functions of leadership is to make difficult decisions concerning the team s direction Sometime this involves saying no to some options that the team might otherwise pursue if left to its own devices Focused on Delivering a Product of Value to a Customer There are four important but closely related elements that I m grouping together here Focus the entire team must be focused on a Craft a Product Vision|goal Product A concrete Stay Focused on the Creation of Working Software for Real People|product forces hard decisions to be made and forces the team to actually produce a tangible result Delivery The team must Deliver Early and Often|deliver something in a limited timeframe again enforcing a degree of discipline Customer The product must be something of Create Value for Customers|value to a real customer Without the ability to visualize such a recipient it is hard for the team to make the sort of often difficult trade off decisions involved in any important work Note that a cross functional team focused on delivery of a single product is sometimes referred to as an Integrated Product Team IPT https en wikipedia org wiki Integrated product team Important Team Characteristics Let me give further emphasis to a couple of important team characteristics First is the cultivation of and adherence to team norms Software development is by its nature a particularly solitary activity Much of the work involves one programmer one keyboard and one computer And the quality and quantity of the work being done in this way is often hard to observe directly This is one reason why <a href= https en wikipedia org wiki Watts Humphrey class= reflink target= ref >Watts Humphrey< a> commented include quote Trying to change the behavior of software engineers And so it is often difficult for even the best intentioned managers and coaches to influence the working habits of individual developers However when a small team is working together to achieve a common goal and when they are committed to delivering working software within a short period of time and when they are allowed to Self Organizing Teams|self organize and when the idea of joint ownership of the software code is promoted and when they agree on a definition of what it means to say they are done with a piece of software then it turns out that the team itself is much more effective at enforcing common norms than is any outside agency When considering team implementation it would also be wise to consider the Core Design Principles for Teams as defined by Nobel Prize Winner Elinor Ostrom and evolutionary biologist David Sloan Wilson Another important team characteristic deserving of further emphasis is that of diversity Research has demonstrated that teams with diverse perspectives and backgrounds tend to produce better results even if the discussions within such a team tend to be a bit messier and less straightforward include quote Diversity helps your business What Can Be Debated I ve tried to summarize above many of the key learnings about effective teams that I ve gleaned over several decades based on my experience working as a team member and team leader and also based on my observations and broad study of the topic in multiple contexts But of course in this brief overview I ve just scratched the surface of the subject Whole books have been written on the topic of teams There is lots of room for discussion and debate on the various elements of teams and team building What Cannot Be Debated At this late date it s probably not useful to waste time debating whether teams like these are important Some would say that there is magic in such teams but I think it s probably fairer to say that there s not much of lasting value produced without such teams Wherever we look today especially when we dig beneath the surface of any of our modern success stories we find abundant evidence of the operation of teams that fit the description I ve provided above Heck I ve so far avoided any mention of sports but I think much of our obsession with this endeavor can be traced back to the importance of teams in our society Every game day we see this fundamental reality played out on the field in front of us with all of the corporate and societal trappings stripped away laying bare the workings of two teams with their members their diverse skills their leaders their activities their collaboration and ultimately their results all there for us to observe and discuss Implications for Your Organization Much of what I ve said above is probably fairly non controversial And yet What are the implications for the larger organization It is probably not too much of a leap to say that successful organizations will be those who do the most to foster sustain and nurture such teams Yet how many organizations embrace this truth as one of their core operating principles Instead leaders of large organizations often seem to lose grasp of what s going on within their teams and as a result lose track of the effects their decisions may have on the operation of these teams After all if leaders observe the business norms of interacting only with those immediately above below or adjacent to them in the organization with only occasional ceremonial contact with any working teams it is all too easy for them to insulate themselves from first hand knowledge of what s happening at this level of their organizations I think this is one reason why the the <a href= https labs spotify com 2014 03 27 spotify engineering culture part 1 class= reflink target= ref >videos on Spotify Engineering Culture< a> have been so popular There are a lot of great ideas here but many team members simply seem to like the fact that a major company thinks their teams are so important that they will release content entirely focused on the way their teams function Let me return to my original assertion > At the core of most of the important work done in this world you will find a small multi skilled team with effective leadership focused on delivering a product of value to a customer If this is true then you need to ask yourself what is your organization doing today to create nurture and sustain these sorts of teams For more on this topic see the Pagan Tuna post 8220 The Power of Diverse Teams 8221 Words from Others on this Topic include

the estimated investment requirements the anticipated returns and the resulting hockey stick chart and decide to fund or not to fund as if these were the only relevant factors However it may be time for IT governance bodies to start acting more like venture capitalists Everyone in the industry has been moaning for decades now about the high failure rates for IT projects usually in order to sell us some new panacea that seems to help for a while but does little in the long run to move the needle But IT projects like entrepreneurial startups are inherently risky investments And so perhaps the job of an IT governance body should be to look for projects where the high opportunities for return outweigh the risks of failure just as a venture capitalist does when evaluating potential investment opportunities If our corporate IT investment boards started operating more like <a href= https en wikipedia org wiki Shark Tank class= reflink target= ref >Shark Tank< a> taking risk factors like the ones above into account then perhaps we would see better overall returns on our software development investments Another important governance function is to ensure that initial project estimates for

tasks require conceptual creative thinking A compelling Craft a Product Vision|product vision can help provide developers with a sense of purpose A Developers are Always Growing|growth opportunity can provide an increased sense of mastery And a high level of autonomy can often be achieved through the implementation of right sized Self Organizing Teams formed so as to implement tight Cohesion and Loose Coupling In order to achieve high levels of engagement though more is required of leadership than mechanical provisioning of these three motivating factors what is really required is a fundamental belief in the value of individuals and egalitarian teams Listen to these words from John Lennon one of four equal members of The Beatles talking about his early decision to allow Paul McCartney to become a member of his group include quote A format of equals But what you may ask does this have to do with the creation of technology products Listen to what Steve Jobs had to say about the Apple management model include quote The Beatles Management Philosophy Still not convinced that the way artists create music has anything to do with the way developers create software Let s try another major branch of music from the 20th century Listen to this description of jazz from Wynton Marsalis include quote The Good Taste of Individuals Now look at these elements of the Agile Manifesto and its accompanying principles emphasis mine We have come to value individuals and interactions over processes and tools Build projects around motivated individuals Give them the environment and support they need and trust them to get the job done Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility The best architectures requirements and designs emerge from self organizing teams At regular intervals the team reflects on how to become more effective then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly Even though the words are different I m struck by the similarity of tone and intent between the two descriptions of these approaches to creation They both incorporate Daniel Pink s motivational components of purpose mastery and autonomy but they do so from a position of fundamental faith a belief in the elevation and enrichment of people plain ol folks The Graphing Calculator Story provides a great example of what developers can accomplish when they can gain access to these three motivating factors Two highly motivated individuals created an exciting and valuable piece of software out of a sense of mission leveraging the varying sorts of technical mastery available from a small set of team members and with a high degree of autonomy And oh by the way they accomplished all this not with active management support but through benign neglect by their management in fact their story is particularly interesting because of the high degree of motivation and success these two developers exhibited after their management had canceled their project and terminated their contracts Which raises the question of the role of management in the care and feeding and motivation of software development teams There seem to be three possible approaches here 1 Management has little faith in the ability of developers and development teams to do good work on their own and so implements a complex system of project reviews management oversight and organizational checks and balances in order to keep them from running off the rails The problem with this approach of course is that it does not provide developers with any sense of autonomy it does not trust that they will be motivated by a sense of purpose and it does not acknowledge or foster any degree of mastery and so does not provide any of the necessary ingredients for developer engagement 2 Management dispassionately distances themselves from their development teams trusting that they will do great work when left to themselves At first this approach sounds like it is doing all the right things and it is often an approach that developers themselves tend to ask for but in truth this too is generally a recipe for failure Management abdication of all responsibility does not often lead to developer success because it does not treat organizational leaders with the same respect it accords to developers 3 Management plays an active engaged role in the formation of teams in hiring and firing the right sorts of people in choosing the right sorts of projects in fostering suitable technical mastery for their developers in developing and communicating a meaningful and helpful sense of purpose to their teams in helping them connect productively to the larger organization and in offering them the benefits of their experience through consultation and guidance In this third way managers don t take themselves out of the game and reduce their roles to cheerleaders on the sidelines but instead act with their own sense of purpose autonomy and mastery to help their teams succeed For more on the similarities between Jazz and Agile see the Pagan Tuna post 8220 Take the Agile Train 8221 Words from Others on this Topic include quote High value construction

        content: "Most software developers enjoy programming And most developers enjoy pleasing their customers This means that left to their own devices developers will tend to focus on quickly delivering new features to their customers The problem here is that some attributes of high quality software are not immediately visible to customers And so left to their own devices many developers will tend to give short shrift to these quality factors Of course it is human nature to pay more attention to short term consequences than long term ones The fact that the cookie tastes good today sways us more than the fact that it will add to our growing waistline tomorrow And the chain of causality linking our actions today to long term consequences often seems murky further decreasing the likelihood that we will take the necessary actions today to achieve our desired ends And then there are the all too common budget and schedule and content pressures that further coerce developer attention onto these short term highly visible results Much of the benefit of Agile arguably comes from moving many of these consequences from the long term to the short term continuous integration for example means that the build is broken today not at some far distant point in the future when integration happens Some might argue that Agile effectively moves all significant consequences into the short term but I don t believe this to be the case Some quality attributes tend not to be as readily apparent as other software attributes no matter how many agile practices you implement Following is a list of some of the most commonly identified software quality attributes These are sometimes referred to collectively as the ilities based on the way most of these terms end Accessibility Availability Compliance with Standards Continuity Correctness of Results even under extreme or unusual or novel conditions Extensibility Graceful Failure Maintainability Manageability Operability Portability Recoverability Reliability Scalability Security Stability Survivability Testability Usability Since developers often have little natural motivation to focus on these attributes a project must generally exert some extra effort to ensure adequate levels of quality Such extra effort could include any or all of the following <a href= https en wikipedia org wiki Non functional requirement class= reflink target= ref >Non Functional Requirements< a> NFRs peer reviews pair programming coding standards architecture reviews code analysis tools automated testing performance and scalability testing dedicated testers defect metrics audits checklists How many of these practices you want or need and in what measure are questions that will require some judgment on the part of leadership and the development team As with many of these Big Ideas getting the right Software Development is a Balancing Act|balance is not an exact science One thing that might help is to have at least a conceptual discussion about the <a href= http en wikipedia org wiki Quality costs class= reflink target= ref >Cost of Quality< a> Although it is not often practical to calculate such a cost with any precision the idea of trying to minimize the overall COQ is still a useful concept for consideration by teams and organizations Introducing elements of a quality program may prove controversial but people should be able to reach some common ground once they agree that the overall goal is to reduce the total cost of quality including both costs of appraisal and prevention as well as direct and indirect costs associated with software failures Preventive practices need not be time consuming or costly In many cases just asking people whether they have done something or asking them to fill out a form attesting that they have done something or asking for evidence that they have done something often has an almost magical ability to influence behavior Because as much as we hate to admit it if leadership does not invest the time and effort to perform such oversight the implicit message is that they don t really want people to take the time to do these things This impression is not the result of some vast conspiracy or a colossal misunderstanding of management s true intentions It is simply the case that all the very real pressures to maximize short term benefits will inevitably influence practitioners to reduce long term benefits unless there is some effective counterweight Much of what I m saying here is confirmed by a fascinating book by Atul Gawande called <cite> The Checklist Manifesto How to Get Things Right < cite> An <a href= http www npr org templates story story php storyId=122226184 class= reflink target= ref >interview with Gawande< a> on the subject of his book is available from NPR Gawande is a surgeon and his book is based on data from doctors and hospitals but it turns out that surgeons are a lot like software developers highly trained highly experienced and performing complex work in which no two problems turn out to be exactly alike When asked to consider the use of simple checklists Gawande reports that most surgeons felt that such things were beneath them constituted meaningless paperwork and were a waste of time When they actually used them though amazing things happened In one study a hospital implemented a simple checklist to perform a series of steps to reduce the chances of patients becoming infected by insertion of central lines to supply intravenous fluids None of the individual steps were remarkable and all the surgeons were already familiar with all of the steps Nonetheless when the checklist was used consistently over a two year period and when nurses were given the authority to stop doctors if they observed them to be skipping any of the steps the hospital calculated that as a direct result use of the checklists had prevented forty three infections and eight deaths and saved two million dollars So it turns out that Watts Humphrey summarized the situation pretty well back in 1989 in <cite> Managing the Software Process < cite> include quote body Hard to be Objective about Auditors Gawande s book confirms Humphrey s analysis Before running his tests most surgeons thought the checklists were a waste of time After having a chance to use them and see the results 80 of the doctors thought they were something they wanted to continue to use The other 20 though remained strongly against it But then the researchers asked one more question If you were to have an operation would you want the checklist Ninety four percent of the doctors then answered in the affirmative For further discussion on the topic of software quality see the Pagan Tuna post 8220 Software Defects

have conflicting requirements Or areas where important stakeholders will be difficult to meet with regularly If you can anticipate areas where requirements definition will be challenging then you

also need to spend some of its time on defect correction as well as refactoring design improvements and technology upgrades The best way to address the need to include these unlike things in your development work is by use of capacity allocation You can renegotiate the percentages allocated to different types of work over time but it s best to introduce the concept early establish some starting agreements and then bake these into your planning assumptions so that you don t over estimate your development capacity You should also plan for time to be spent on integration and hardening Will you have one or more teams working semi independently on different pieces of your system If so be sure to factor in time and resources for integration testing and hardening of the integrated solution This may come in the form of a periodic hardening sprint or additional integration work as part of each development sprint However you incorporate it into your plan though such work will consume additional time that would otherwise be available for development of new features All of these factors as well as others should be considered as part of your initial planning However plans should never be regarded as written in stone They are always works in progress and always subject to further change The Manifesto for Agile Software Development expresses this idea by stating that its

        content: "When we talk about software development we often use terms like engineering or architecture and draw on lessons learned from other environments implying that developing software is like building a house or designing a new consumer product However there are some very fundamental differences between software and these other sorts of products and we need to keep these in mind in order to talk sensibly about software development 1 Triviality of the Manufacturing Step The goal of software development is to develop something new to create meaningful variation while the goal of manufacturing is to build the same thing over and over again to minimize or eliminate variation Within other forms of product development significant attention is paid to manufacturing the product from a set of design documents In most cases many different units will be built of an identical design so there is a repetitive element to the manufacturing process resulting in a focus on driving out variation in manufacturing Also there is typically a human element in the manufacturing process and so product quality and the risk of errors introduced in manufacturing receive much attention For software however the design documents are the program source code and manufacturing consists of building actual executables from the source This is a process that is completely automated by compilers linkers and other build tools and so is relatively trivial One implication of this fact is that it is much less meaningful to separate design from construction in software development In hardware development it is absolutely essential to create detailed product design models and documents from which physical products can be reliably and repeatedly manufactured However since we are only ever building one instance of any detailed software design there are diminishing returns for increasing levels of detail in software design documentation And so the software code actually becomes the detailed design documentation 2 Absence of Physical Substance There is no physical material involved in software construction so there is no need for material transformation from one form to another and no need for material transportation from one location to another In fact the only thing flowing through the software development process is information And unlike material information can be in two or more places at the same time and can flow in multiple directions concurrently Because there is no need to order raw material or components to feed a physical assembly line there is no natural gate between design and construction as there is with physical products 3 Product Malleability Software is easy to change And once you have changed it it is easy to regenerate the executables manufacture it So while we often talk about the high cost of change most of the costs are in coordination and communication and are not fixed costs based on material or manufacturing costs And so while there are rework costs the measure twice cut once approach is less relevant to software than it is to hardware And software is often able to evolve more quickly than physical products 4 Diversity of Purpose While aeronautical engineering for example is about making things fly the purposes to which software can be applied are amazingly diverse and becoming more so all the time So the things that work well for someone developing image processing software may be different from what works well for someone developing software to process banking transactions 5 Rapidly Changing Context When one considers other engineering fields there is generally some physical context for the discipline that changes infrequently or not at all A chemical engineer operates within the field of chemistry for example and the number of elements and the basic chemical laws rarely if ever change Other engineering fields are based on physics or thermodynamics or some other relatively unchanging body of knowledge about the physical world On the other hand software engineers are operating within the constraints of the hardware available to them and within the specified software environment both of which are changing rapidly and often in unpredictable ways So if a student studies chemical engineering then he or she can be relatively confident that what they learn will be of use to them over their entire careers as chemical engineers On the other hand software engineers often study languages operating systems and hardware environments that may be entirely different five years after they have completed their studies 6 Layers of Abstraction Related issues are the complexity and mutability of the layers of software abstraction surrounding the problem domain in which the software developer is working Many developers today for example develop software that sits on top of an operating system a database management system application integration middleware a web server an application server and a set of language subroutine class libraries all of which are in more or less constant flux 7 Scale Watts Humphrey has made the point that a civil engineer when considering the height of a structure only has to worry about roughly two orders of magnitude difference between the smallest and the largest product he is likely to be called upon to design that is the tallest structure he is likely to work on is no more than roughly 100 times the size of the shortest structure On the other hand software developers in college start out learning to write individual programs of roughly 1000 lines but then in the real world are expected to work on projects developing more than a million lines of code in other words a difference of roughly three orders of magnitude Humphrey has gone on to suggest strongly that practices that work well at the lower end of this range are not likely to scale well to the upper end Words from Others on this Topic include quote Software is a

Balancing Act|polarize this discussion into document everything vs document nothing since both of those extremes are generally disastrous Also watch out for ceremonial approvals of documents When ten people have to approve everything that s been written down that s a sure sign that no one understands any of it and no one trusts anyone else The first step on the road to documentation sanity is to ask ourselves whether we have a good reason for creating a document Reasons for Documentation There are generally three different reasons to create software documentation These three broad purposes really correspond to three distinct audiences All software documentation should be aligned with one or ideally more of these three purposes These three purposes are A To clarify expectations among those involved in the project B To define and explain aspects of the system useful to future users and developers and not readily apparent from examination of the software itself C To provide transparency of agency and intention to potentially interested parties outside of the project Elaboration on Reasons Now that you ve seen the list in its entirety let me elaborate with some additional comments and corollaries A To clarify expectations among those involved in the project 1 By those involved in the project I mean to include people and organizations involved in the project to any degree including customers sponsors architects etc 2 By clarify expectations I mean to imply that written documentation will not necessarily be the only or even the primary communications vehicle used to establish those expectations 3 An important corollary is that if expectations are already clear or can be more readily clarified through some other more effective or cost efficient form of communication then the software documentation is not needed 4 Another important corollary is that if the documentation does not actually provide any clarity then it s not fulfilling its purpose 5 Note that expectations can become muddied over time due to memory lapses or competition with other information so part of this clarification of expectations may actually be as a reminder of what had been clear at one time in the past B To define and explain aspects of the system useful to future users and developers and not readily apparent from examination of the software itself 1 Some level of system documentation typically needs to be done to help clarify aspects of the system over what is often a fairly long useful life for the software we write 2 Both users and developers tend to develop their knowledge of a system through examination of the software itself users through the user interface and actual behavior of the software and developers additionally through the examination of the source code This is often the case because the actual software is typically more credible and as easy or easier to understand than the documentation C To provide transparency of agency and intention to potentially interested parties outside of the project 1 This is often the purpose that is hardest for developers to understand and accept 2 In cases where software produces inaccurate or even dangerous results outside parties often need access to documentation that will indicate who authorized the offending code and with what intent 3 Even if such problems seem unlikely as they often do to people closest to the software such transparency can be justified to help deter malicious or careless software changes 4 A critical aspect of this sort of documentation is that it be part of an unbroken chain starting with a real request from a real person and ending with the actual lines of software code that were changed Guidance OK now that we re clear on the purpose of our documentation how does this help I believe there is some very practical guidance we can provide based on the purpose of the documentation If the purpose of your documentation is to clarify expectations among those involved in the project then 1 Be aware that the need for such documentation although not its effectiveness seems to increase exponentially with the size of the project both in terms of team size and duration The smaller the project the less of this sort of documentation you will need 2 If you are stuck with a large project then Decomposition|decomposing it into smaller sub projects that can be done in parallel and or serially can help to reduce the amount of documentation needed 3 On large projects plan for the necessary resources to do a good job of the documentation with enough time and the right resources to produce documentation that team members will actually find useful Remember that all other things being equal more documentation is worse and concise easily understood documentation that focuses on the most likely issues of confusion contention is better If the purpose of your documentation is to define and explain aspects of the system useful to future users and developers and not readily apparent from examination of the software itself then 1 Detailed developer documentation is best maintained within the source code itself Since developers will look at the code anyway your documentation is much more likely to be read and maintained if it is included as comments within the program code 2 High level documentation should be sparse enough that it has a reasonable chance of being read and maintained over the life of the system Focus on high level information like design intent that is often hard to abstract from the code itself 3 If your users are having a hard time understanding your system then your time may be better spent on improving the user interface than on additional documentation that many will likely not read anyway If the purpose of your documentation is to provide transparency of agency and intention to potentially interested parties outside of the project then 1 The larger the project the more tangled these issues become so again shorter and smaller projects tend to require less documentation 2 The best way to accomplish the needed traceability is through automated change management and version control systems that are joined at the hip with both the source code itself and the system documentation being under version control Words from Others on this Topic include quote The land of the template zombies include quote

architecture There are at least two different points to be clarified here <h2 id= architecture vs design >Architecture vs Design< h2> The terms architecture and design have very similar definitions so in many contexts they are used to denote the same thing and are used interchangeably If we are to try to make a distinction though then architecture usually refers to a more elevated level of design expressed at a higher level of abstraction and or an earlier stage of design More significantly perhaps architecture may prescribe a series of patterns to be used on the project with instantiation of those patterns constituting more detailed design work In this sense the overall solution architecture must be established before detailed design can occur and the detailed design must work within and be constrained by the overall architecture <h2 id= architectural areas >Architectural Areas< h2> When we discuss the architecture of a system there are at least five different albeit related areas that must be considered Information What are the major entities objects facets to be considered by the system and how will each of these things be identified Functional What business functions will be performed and how do they relate to each other and to other functions that are out of scope User Interface How will the user navigate through the system what will the system look like and what sort of special controls or other UI elements may be needed Technology Infrastructure What are the technologies to be used by the project and what roles will those technologies play On what infrastructure both hardware and software will the application run What development tools will be used Software What software modules or module types will be written and how will they relate to each other If you are missing any one of these then you don t have a complete architecture <h2 id= architectural drivers >Architectural Drivers< h2> Architecture is driven primarily by four different items Enterprise Architecture The application architecture must work within Enterprise standards principles and guidelines Segment Domain Architecture Similarly the application must respect the boundaries and guidance established for the particular domain that it occupies Business Functional Requirements The application architecture will obviously be strongly influenced by the particular business functions the application must perform Non Functional Requirements NFRs These are often requirements that define desired quality attributes of the system to be developed <h2 id= consideration of alternatives and tradeoffs >Consideration of Alternatives and Trade Offs< h2> Whether you are using agile practices or a more traditional methodology one hallmark of a worthwhile approach to architecture design is the consideration of alternatives and the evaluation of trade offs between those alternatives A common error is to assume certain architectural elements and so to adopt them without discussion perhaps because developers on the team have used certain architectures before and so bring them along with them to their next project In this respect it is helpful to keep in mind some research on diversity forbes indicating that more heterogenous teams often feel that they are struggling and floundering when compared to more homogenous ones and yet actually perform better than their less diverse counterparts <h2 id= timing of architecture and design >Timing of Architecture and Design< h2> In traditional software development architecture and design are typically done and completed before coding starts as part of the well known waterfall approach wf Some agile enthusiasts advocate for the opposite approach touting emergent design emdesign and simply jump into coding with little or no architectural preparation And while this may work for small efforts building on established architectures it often falls short in larger efforts and may lead to floundering and rework and poor designs that fail to stand up over time A reasonable compromise is represented by the JEDUF approach Just Enough Design Up Front With this approach some major design decisions are made before coding while still allowing for more detailed design to emerge during development and with the understanding that some refactoring may occur in order to optimize designs in the face of new discoveries that will arise along the way On large projects programs however the combination of some initial architecture followed by emergent design during sprints may still not be sufficient to provide for the right amount of architecture at the right time <h2 id= architectural runway and enabler epics >Architectural Runway and Enabler Epics< h2> When decomposing the work to be done on a large agile project it can be useful to start with a number of epics to be implemented with each epic later being broken down into a number of features and each feature eventually being broken down into stories With this approach it may be helpful to distinguish between Architectural epics and Business Functional epics with the former laying the foundation upon which the latter will be built Another popular way to think about this is that the Architectural epics extend the runway far enough to allow the Business Functional epics to proceed without disruption with the architecture always being done just far enough in advance to prevent the business functional work from running out of runway The Scaled Agile Framework safe SAFe calls these architectural pieces of work enablers and that s a good way to think about them the enablers allow the next chunk of business functional development to proceed <h2 id= a project roadmap >A Project Roadmap< h2> Agile projects try to maximize flexibility by lumping all work to be done into a backlog with the idea that items can be added subtracted and reprioritized at will without any unnecessary constraints on content or sequence of execution While this sort of flexibility is admirable by the time you are building a high level backlog out of both enabler and business epics your are certainly beginning to run into some dependencies that will suggest some sequence to the work to be done At this point it is probably best to begin to represent the epics to be worked both enablers and business epics in a roadmap of some kind and not simply as a backlog The roadmap should still be subject to change it shouldn t be cast in stone but it is important to understand when various pieces of runway will need to be extended and what other work will need that runway in order to proceed <h2 id= architectural deliverables >Architectural Deliverables< h2> Agile practitioners are sometimes a bit vague about what is actually produced out of architectural work and so it is worthwhile to be explicit about what deliverables will be produced by enabler epics These deliverables essentially fall into three categories Reference designs including patterns to be used by subsequent business functional development Hardware and software components infrastructure and or reusable application components needed to enable later business functional work These are not just designs but actual bits of hardware and software that can be used by the application Proofs of concept that demonstrate the feasibility of the design work done and the readiness to proceed with subsequent business functional development <h2 id= project cadence >Project Cadence< h2> A foundational element of all agile development is the regular cadence of the work being done Teams work in short sprints aka iterations of 1 4 weeks More substantial projects may group multiple team sprints into larger chunks of work such as the Program Increments pi or PIs defined by SAFe The work to be done is then subdivided into pieces small enough that they can be worked reliably within this regular cadence rather than adjusting start and stop dates to fit the size of the work But how do we fit architectural work into such a cadence If any accommodation for this work is made at all it is sometimes done by allowing for some fixed amount of architecture work to be done at the start of each iteration or each program increment or at the end of each in preparation for the next There are two problems with this sort of cadenced approach to architecture The need for architectural work does not occur at such regular intervals The length of time needed for each piece of architecture can vary considerably and so cannot be reliably squeezed into a fixed amount of time for each increment A better approach is to allow the work planned for each iteration increment to consist of some combination of architectural enablers and business functional development with the amount of architectural work and its timing determined based on the project roadmap being followed An enabler epic then could be started at any point in the project and could complete after one two or three or more iterations increments as many as are needed to complete the work These intermittent injections of architectural work into the team s regular cadence are sometimes referred to as spikes a term that reflects the uneven distribution of this work over the course of the project With such an approach once the pump is primed with the initial architecture enabler work and business development will proceed in parallel with the enabler work timed to keep the runway built in advance of the proceeding business work <h2 id= design reviews and gates >Design Reviews and Gates< h2> If you are working in an environment where design reviews and perhaps even firm gates are required then the natural place for these to occur is at the end of each architecture enabler epic These can be planned in advance based on the project roadmap and the deliverables specified above can be inspected as part of these reviews <h2 id= what about detailed design >What About Detailed Design < h2> The detailed functional design of particular screens reports and interfaces can be done as part of the normal development work done within each iteration increment so long as this work is based on the more general architectural work already performed <h2 id= what about emergent learning >What About Emergent Learning < h2> The guidance provided above is intended to help large and complex projects navigate their ways through some of the difficulties often encountered when doing architectural work But the desire to rigidly follow an established architecture must always be weighed against the potential benefits of adapting to take advantage of new learnings that emerge doing the development work It is always good to design before you build but software development is a complex business and there is no guarantee you will get everything right before you start building <h2 id= who does architecture >Who Does Architecture < h2> In a large enterprise you will often have several layers of architects Enterprise architects sit at the top of the pyramid helping to guide and govern development work across the entire scope of the business and establishing principles and standards to be followed by projects At the next layer you may have domain segment architects who try to understand a particular segment of the business and work out the relationships between the various data stores and applications serving that domain Application architects then will be responsible for the architecture of particular applications and it is this work that has been the focus of our discussion today Within agile the explicit role of an architect is often omitted giving way to the egalitarian desire to let all developers participate equally in design work And while it is generally good to foster creativity throughout the team and to empower developers to contribute to design work the truth is that in most successful agile projects you will find a lead developer who ends up guiding and shaping most of the architecture design for the application You can call him or her what you will but once you set out to be more intentional about the way architecture design work is performed on an agile project you will also need to be a bit more explicit about the roles involved as well agilistas http www urbandictionary com define php term=Agilista emdesign http www agilesherpa org agile coach

        summary: "<p><em>Originally published at PaganTuna.com on 21 Mar 2015.</em> </p>\n\n<p>For those who have not yet heard of it, the Scaled Agile Framework, or SAFe&#174; </p>", 
        content: " Originally published at PaganTuna com on 21 Mar 2015 For those who have not yet heard of it the Scaled Agile Framework or SAFe 174 for short is a publicly available framework for applying lean agile practices at Enterprise scale I believe that the SAFe model offers a number of benefits to those who may be considering its use Let me enumerate them 1 It is publicly available and free to use While the SAFe materials are protected by copyright with restrictions that prevent others from modifying the materials or redistributing them the entirety of SAFe is available at ScaledAgileFramework com safe along with the permissive statement that all enterprises and practitioners can use any of the concepts and ideas on the site and even implement the framework know how described on the site free of charge 2 It is available in a highly approachable usable form The framework is available as a website with a diagram on the home page The Big Picture that shows all of the key deliverables roles activities and flows and also serves as a navigational aid to the rest of the site In general the site is only one level deep the user clicks from the Big Picture to a page providing brief definitions and explanations and then goes back to the home page 3 It is lightweight in the best sense of the term Unlike the CMMI 174 or ITIL 174 or other somewhat comparable industry frameworks this is not a massive tome that requires years of dedication to master each graphic on the home page takes you to a single web page consisting of a quotation or two a graphic or two some key definitions and concepts and then reference links to additional details that can be found in some other generally more comprehensive sources 4 It is practical Unlike some other industry frameworks which are more generalized in the sense that they offer you guidelines for process development rather than processes themselves the Scaled Agile Framework is immediately usable by practitioners Its target audience consists of people doing software development not people helping others write processes about how to do software development 5 It is specific SAFe offers specific terms concepts and practices to be used by software developers Whereas other frameworks have taken the direction of ever increasing generalization and abstraction SAFe is specifically focused on how to use agile and lean practices to develop software Note that because it is specific it is somewhat more controversial than other more generalized process frameworks One may not like the CMMI or find it useful but it is hard to argue with it because it is so abstract that is hard to take exception with any of it The Scaled Agile Framework in that sense is not playing it safe instead it picks sides and places bets This aspect of the work makes some people uncomfortable but arguably it also makes the work much more useful for those who are more interested in developing software than in debating methodologies 6 It conveniently codifies some of the most common agile practices in use today As examples definitions for agile teams product owner scrum master and other common terms and concepts are represented on The Big Picture with definitions and explanations just a click away 7 It offers useful extensions to common agile practices Most agile practices in common use today are based on Scrum and or XP which are really focused at the practitioner and team levels SAFe extends the agile model up to the program and portfolio levels It does this by again codifying many elements in common use today things like the the hierarchy of epics features and stories but also by adding novel yet useful concepts such as the idea of the Agile Release Train the term SAFe uses for the Program level equivalent of Agile Teams 8 It grounds agile practices in an enterprise context Many agile models are really very developer centric they seem to depict the entire development process from the perspective of a developer or a development team SAFe still leverages all of the by now traditional elements of agile and yet it also places software development realistically in the context of an enterprise that is served by such teams As one example SAFe acknowledges that estimates will need to be done at the program and portfolio levels based on definitions of epics and features before descending to the level of granularity needed for stories and story points This is sometimes viewed as sacrilege by agile coaches and practitioners steeped in team based practices but it is a necessity for doing agile at scale within the context of large organizations 9 It offers a complete picture of software development Roles of Enterprise Architect and System Architect are included in the model as are the concepts of Architectural Epics Architectural Features and Architectural Runway UX experts and DevOps teams are given roles to play Product Managers are included as well as Product Owners Non Functional Requirements are included in the model So while the SAFe model is relatively simple it is not simplistic It includes all the elements that are actually needed to develop and deliver software in a modern enterprise context 10 It is regularly maintained Ongoing SAFe development seems to moving along at a good clip While there have been no drastic changes that would cause distress to early adopters there has been a steady pace of ongoing progress and polishing SAFe is now at version 3 0 and a preview of 4 0 is available So the SAFe team seems to be releasing one new version per year And ongoing evolution seems to be based on actual experience using the model in the field rather than on abstract theorization In Summary So there you have it ten reasons to give serious consideration to the use of SAFe within your enterprise I documented my reservations about the CMMI back in 2008 While I doubt that Dean Leffingwell and company have read my blog post on that topic they do seem to have systematically gone down my list of reservations and addressed them all one by one Back in 1992 Edward Yourdon wrote about the original Capability Maturity Model Until you can find a better map this one sure beats wandering through the forest in the dark Two decades later I think it s time to say something similar about the Scaled Agile Framework it may not be perfect but if you re trying to implement agile within a large organization it s better than wandering through the woods on your own Further Reading + Agile Scaling SAFe Best Practices for Scrum Masters https www toptal com project

        content: " First published at PaganTuna com on 6 Jun 2009 I m taking a Mac programming course this semester and as I wade into the strange world of Objective C and the Cocoa frameworks I ve been forcibly reminded of the Dreyfus Model of Skill Acquisition dreyfus model First proposed by Stuart and Hubert Dreyfus in 1980 the model suggests that people go through roughly five stages as they acquire new skills 1 Novice rigid adherence to rules no discretional judgment does not feel responsible for outcomes 2 Advanced beginner situational perception still limited all aspects of work are treated separately and given equal importance does not feel responsible for outcomes 3 Competent coping with crowdedness multiple activity information now partially sees action as part of longer term goals conscious deliberate planning starts to feel accountability for outcomes 4 Proficient holistic view of situation rather than in terms of aspects sees what is most important in a situation uses maxims for guidance meaning of maxims may vary according to situation feels responsible for results 5 Expert no longer reliant on rules guidelines maxims intuitive grasp of situation based on tacit knowledge vision of what is possible accepts responsibility for results For anyone deliverings training or peddling processes or methodologies or sets of best practices the Dreyfus model has a number of important implications 1 When learning something new everyone starts out as a novice no matter how much they know in other fields 2 The goal of education should be to gradually move people up the scale towards expertise There is no way to do this overnight it takes time 3 The most training can do is provide the rules that will help people achieve novice status Experience is required in order for people to move up the scale in the direction of expertise 4 Note that at lower levels on this scale people only feel accountable for following the rules they ve been given not for the actual results achieved While this is reasonable this is one excellent reason why you want to move people up the scale as quickly as possible especially in complex fields such as software development where simple rules are rarely sufficient to achieve success 5 If you cannot create teams composed entirely of experts then it is wise to have at least one expert on each team and have them act as a lead who can mentor and oversee the work of others And of course if such a lead is given sufficient authority and support then they will feel a sense of accountability for the success of the team 6 It is entirely possible for a novice to follow the rules they ve been given and when facing a complex problem without help from an expert to fail miserably Note that according to the model such a person will feel no great discomfort since they only felt accountable for following the rules and not for the results In fact if their organizational environment allows this to happen such a novice can have this experience repeatedly However it is not likely that a succession of such failures will help someone advance up the scale towards expertise very quickly if at all 7 At lower levels of this model people want and need specific rules to follow At higher levels though experts will have internalized such rules will no longer need to refer to them in explicit written form and will often bend or break those rules in response to the specifics of their situation This is why it is often only the new guy or gal who actually follows the letter of the law in terms of departmental procedures 8 When the rules change the experts will often give you the most trouble because they will tend to assume that their tacit knowledge still applies and will want to continue to operate at the level of expertise they have grown used to 9 It is essential to provide written rules since those at the lower level of this scale will be lost without them 10 Beginners will often demand more and better rules since from their perspective that is all they have and if they experience failure they will tend to think that more and better rules are the answer Beyond a certain point though additional and more complex rule sets provide rapidly diminishing returns and in fact may simply make it more difficult for novices to advance up the scale towards expertise since all their efforts will go towards retaining some knowledge of the latest rules 11 Your best most valuable performers will be frustrated and have their performance inhibited by an organizational approach that is overly insistent on strict adherence to very detailed prescriptive sets of rules 12 The best rule makers tend to come from the middle of this scale at the competent level Those operating at the higher levels tend not to have enough awareness of the rules to be able to document them By the way thanks to Dan North north who first made me aware of the Dreyfus model and some of its implications in the field of software

        summary: "<p>*Note: This post was originally published on August 10, 2010. </p>", 
        content: " Note This post was originally published on August 10 2010 It was updated on Oct 7 8 2012 to provide some additional clarity around elements that were still proving confusing to some In all my years working on IT projects I think I ve observed more silliness around the topic of Earned Value Management evm or EVM for those in the know than on any other subject I can think of The many varieties of dysfunction that people exhibit towards this project management tool tend to place them in one of the following categories Those who have no idea what it is but are sure they don t need it Those who view EVM as a necessary evil like some sort of pagan god periodically demanding a ritual sacrifice from its followers Those who treat EVM numbers as powerful omens foreshadowing their fates as if massaging the numbers to change the resulting stoplight colors could actually positively influence the outcomes of their projects Those who rely on amulets and talismans to keep the evil EVM from their doors such as estimates that seem to always fall just a hair under the threshold that would trigger a hard and fast requirement for it Those high priests and priestesses of EVM who use a familiarity with its mystical language and calculations as an avenging force to root out and punish the unbelievers In practice I ve found much of this behavior to be based on a lack of understanding about what EVM is how it works and what it is good for So let me try to cast a few rays of light into the darkness that often surrounds this subject The Case for EVM The easiest way to understand the problem that EVM is trying to solve is by describing the all too frequently observed characteristics of an IT project without EVM The typical scenario is that the project is reported by everyone involved to be in good shape until it nears its planned completion date at which point it enters the dreaded almost done state and then stays there for what seems like and often actually is an eternity before being finally brought to some sort of dreary conclusion usually through forced removal of life support In other words the problem can be stated thusly there is a strong human predisposition to assume with the consumption of budget and the passing of time that actual project progress is proceeding at the same pace Sadly facts recorded at project completion have repeatedly failed to demonstrate this correlation The 90 Done Dilemma images evm png The 90 Done Dilemma The Essence of EVM Here is the best analogy I ve been able to come up with to explain how EVM works Let s say that you are flying from Los Angeles to New York in order to serve as best man at your friend s wedding You fill up the plane s gas tank you figure out what time you have to get there and you take off OK You ve been up in the air for an hour The land below is skimming by at a reassuring rate The needle on the gas tank shows that you ve got plenty of gas left Life is good right What could go wrong Well two things actually 1 You could get there an hour late thus missing the ceremony in which case you may as well have stayed home 2 You could run out of gas before you get there in which case you would plummet to a fiery death Since neither of these outcomes appears desirable you might look for some reassurance that you will avoid them both So what additional data do you need Two things 1 You need to know your speed so you can calculate when you will arrive 2 You need to know your mileage or the miles per gallon you are achieving to know whether your fuel supply will get you to your destination EVM is simply a way of calculating these two pieces of data for a project The first is called schedule performance and is the equivalent of speed The second is called cost performance and is the equivalent of mileage since a project s budget is equivalent to a plane s fuel For an airplane of course progress can be measured in miles traveled For a project progress is measured by tasks completed And since unlike miles all tasks are not of the same size you need to factor in the size of each task as well Oh and one more thing since we lack any absolute units of measurement for project progress no easy equivalent to miles in our analogy our performance numbers are calculated as indices in which we compare our actuals to our plan So a value of 1 00 means that we are precisely on our plan A value greater than 1 means that we are doing better than our plan A value of less than 1 means that we are not doing as well as we had planned That s pretty much the whole thing in a nutshell Those Confusing Formulae Here is where most people run off the rails and become convinced that if they never hear of EVM again it will be too soon Feel free to skip this section if it makes your head spin It s not all that important unless you re the person who will actually be doing the EVM calculations Here are the key terms used Budgeted Cost of Work Performed BCWP The amount of work actually completed so far measured in terms of the total budgeted i e planned cost for all tasks completed to date This is also referred to as the earned value Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled BCWS The amount of work we had planned to complete by now measured in terms of the total budgeted costs for all of the tasks that were planned to be completed by this date Actual Cost of Work Performed ACWP The amount of money we ve actually spent to get us this far And here are the two key formulas Schedule Performance Index SPI = Budgeted Cost of Work Performed BCWP Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled BCWS In other words how much work we ve actually done at this point compared to how much work we had planned to get done Your SPI is an indication of how fast you can complete the work In our airplane analogy above SPI would be equivalent to groundspeed Cost Performance Index CPI = Budgeted Cost of Work Performed BCWP Actual Cost of Work Performed ACWP In other words how much we had planned to spend on the work we ve completed vs how much we ve actually spent Your CPI is an indication of how costly it is to perform the work In our airplane analogy above CPI would be equivalent to miles per gallon One other point may be helpful if most of your costs are in labor and most of your labor is paid at roughly the same rate then you can substitute hours for dollars in your calculations and still achieve essentially the same results Work Breakdown and Estimating For a complex project involving many different types and sizes of activities it is important to decompose the overall statement of work into lower level tasks that will become the basis for your project plan This decomposition is known as your Work Breakdown Structure WBS Each of these tasks can then be estimated in terms of effort or cost and then based on the planned availability of your resources these tasks can be scheduled This then becomes your project plan from which your budgeted costs can be derived In an ideal situation all of this work breakdown estimating and planning will have occurred before any budget or schedule has been assigned to the project In a less than ideal situation the project s budget and schedule may have been derived from higher level estimates or even from wishful thinking In either case it is still important to perform the more detailed work breakdown however then the task of estimating turns into a task of allocation how much of the project s available budget and time is it reasonable to allocate to each task This allocation should be done on relative estimated sizes however it is important that all of the project s budget and schedule and no more be allocated to planned tasks save possibly for some amount of prudent management reserve Reasons for Variations It s worthwhile noting that if your SPI and CPI numbers are not perfect this will always be due to one or more of the following three factors To help explain these causal factors it may help to think of a bricklaying job Let s say that you need to lay 80 bricks and you re planning to have two bricklayers who can each lay 10 bricks an hour and who charge $20 an hour Therefore you are planning for the job to be done in 4 hours at a cost of $160 Available Resources If you have fewer resources than planned then this will tend to drag down your schedule performance SPI Conversely if you have more resources than planned this will tend to improve your SPI In other words if only one bricklayer shows up to work then it will take him 8 hours instead of 4 working by himself Note that the number of resources you have will not affect your cost performance CPI In our example having only one bricklayer will delay the job s completion but it won t cost you any more Efficiency Productivity If your resources are less productive than planned then this will tend to drag down both your CPI and your SPI Conversely if they are more productive then this will tend to improve both In other words if both bricklayers show up to work but they only lay 5 bricks an hour the job will take 8 hours instead of 4 and will cost you $320 instead of $160 Note that in EVM terms the words productive and efficient or their opposites are not meant to necessarily reflect well or poorly on the value of the workers Your CPI could be low because your workers are less productive than their peers or because your estimates of how much work they could produce per unit of time were overly optimistic From an EVM perspective either of these conditions would result in a low CPI and hence a low productivity Scope Let s say that you re building a wall with your 80 bricks and the size of the job was based on your customer s measurements of how long the wall needed to be Now if you show up at the customer s site and it turns out the wall needs to be twice as long as the customer had previously indicated then it will take 8 hours to complete the job and will cost $320 In this case however neither the SPI nor the CPI were off but instead the scope or size of the job doubled This should cause you to renegotiate your contract and modify your plan accordingly Reacting to EVM Variations I ve seen cases where any sort of variation from CPI and SPI numbers between 0 99 and 1 01 resulted in general panic and manning of the lifeboats but more discriminating responses are generally called for Small and short term variations from SPI and CPI numbers of 1 00 probably need no special attention More sizable variations should typically elicit responses along the lines indicated below based on the particular combination of SPI and CPI variations you have <dl> <dt>CPI gt or = 1 and SPI lt 1 < dt> <dd>Your resources are performing well but you are not getting as many as planned you need to make resources more available e g by providing more people and or overtime < dd> <dt>CPI gt 1 and SPI gt 1 < dt> <dd>Life is good you can assign some resources to other tasks and still complete on time and under budget or you can keep your current resources and finish ahead of schedule and under budget On the other hand management will probably think you re padding your estimates on the next project and so will trim them accordingly < dd> <dt>CPI lt 1 and SPI lt 1 < dt> <dd>You are getting the resources you planned but they are not performing as well as you had planned you will need to de scope or improve performance to correct SPI amp CPI or acquire additional resources to correct SPI < dd> <dt>CPI lt 1 and SPI gt 1 < dt> <dd>You are on schedule but only because you are applying more resources than planned You will need to de scope or improve performance to avoid going over budget < dd> < dl> Implementation Tips Here are a few simple tips for an effective EVM implementation 1 The work in your project should be broken down into relatively discrete tasks roughly one to two weeks in duration If you end up with one or more large amorphous tasks then you have just reproduced essentially the same problem statement that we started with only at a slightly lower level 2 Each task should produce a deliverable whose completeness can be easily and objectively determined In other words there should not be a lot of room for debate about whether a particular task is done yet or not otherwise you are liable to find out at the end of the project that tasks you thought were done are really still in varying states of completion 3 Your project team needs to take ownership of the EVM numbers and the results of the calculations In practice the only way I know to achieve that is to have the entire team review their EVM numbers on a weekly basis The Agile Controversy One question that often arises is whether it is valid or necessary to apply EVM to Agile projects Let s think about this for a minute In order to implement EVM we need to break our work down into discrete tasks each task needs to have a discrete deliverable that can be readily determined to be done or not we need to objectively track our progress against our backlog of tasks yet to be completed we re more concerned with the quantity of work completed than which specific tasks were completed Hmmm In Agile we break our work down into features and features into tasks we deliver those features on a regular basis with short delivery cycles the team has a definition of done for each feature the backlog is dynamic we regularly track features delivered vs features still in our backlog Oh Wait a minute I get it Agile is essentially a form of EVM for software projects So the Agile vs EVM controversy should be a non issue so long as the project is estimating all of the work needed for a project at some level and not just whatever happens to fit in the current iteration If an agile project needs to feed data into a more traditional EVM system then that should be easy to arrange If All You Have is a Hammer Not every project management issue is a nail that can be driven into place with the hammer of EVM For one

        content: " Originally published at PaganTuna com on 28 Aug 2013 Elimination of waste is one of the core principles of lean But we often think of waste and its elimination in purely economic terms a particular lean improvement saved a certain number of dollars or a certain number of hours per year There is also value though in visualizing waste in the form of organizational friction the resistance that workers encounter when trying to do their jobs or when trying to change the way that their jobs are done I say this because in my experience managers and workers often have different motivations when it comes to lean Managers are often motivated by numbers especially when they figure prominently in their annual goals and objectives and especially when they have dollar signs in front of them As managers though we need to realize that these sorts of quantitative measures are in some sense just an abstraction of what is happening on the floor or wherever the work gets done in our organizations And what is happening on the floor as experienced by our workers Either their jobs are getting easier or they are getting harder Either they find it easy to do work that adds real value or they find themselves hindered by organizational impediments And when they try to make constructive changes in the ways that their work is done either they find it easy to make such changes or they encounter resistance In other words they are either fighting against organizational friction or their work is proceeding smoothly with no obstruction And why is it important to visualize waste in this fashion First because it can easily be observed If you come to me with two different schemes for accomplishing a task then it may require expensive time and motion studies to actually determine which method is most efficient But if I observe the work being done in my organization or spend a few minutes listening to an employee talk about the work they ve done recently or even if I simply notice how an employee feels about his or her work then the friction that I m talking about is easily observable The places where friction is occurring become obvious pretty quickly I m having to wait for someone to approve my request or I m having to fill out long forms in order to get someone else to help me do my job or someone has changed their mind fifteen times about what it is they want me to do or a certain tool is unreliable or the list of possible sources of friction can go on and on But just as mechanical friction generates heat organizational friction also generates clear signs that it is occurring So signs of friction are generally pretty obvious But then as organizational leaders what happens if we ignore such signs or are insensitive to them What happens if we are counting up our lean savings for the year while our workers are struggling to overcome sources of friction right outside of our offices This is the really dangerous point Because if we see such friction occurring and we take no steps to eliminate the friction then in my experience our workers start to see value in fighting against the friction or even in creating and maintaining the sources of friction After all if we are not eliminating the friction then we must be embracing it And this enshrinement of friction is also pretty obvious once we begin to notice it My look how hard I worked to get my job done today Look at the long list of obstacles I overcame Look how much overtime I put in so that we could meet our schedule Look at how well I fought off an attempt by another organization to get us to change the ways we do things over here So what is happening in your organization Are your employees constantly fighting against friction in order to get their jobs done or in order to make constructive changes Are you working to eliminate friction from your organization or are you turning a blind eye to it and thus tacitly condoning it or even celebrating it Are you happy to see employees who get their jobs done easily and leave work feeling energized at the end of a normal shift Or are you happier to see employees struggling mightily to get their work done and leaving work exhausted after putting in overtime to get a normal day s work done Or to put it most simply are you fighting to eliminate friction from your organization or are your employees constantly fighting against it lean http en m wikipedia org wiki Lean manufacturing"

        content: " Introduction When companies attempt to implement lean principles some of their biggest stumbling blocks seem to be the cultural elements While some of the Toyota methods are very clear and specific the cultural issues often seem more difficult to pin down Many organizations seem to translate the most obvious elements into terms that they are comfortable with but something often seems to get lost in the translation and their lean implementations struggle because they have not really modified some of the basic ways in which they think about their work It occurred to me recently that the basic differences in lean culture might be represented in a very simple model At first the simplicity of the model seemed to be too good to be true but the more I thought about it the more it seemed to help clearly explain some of the issues that typically cause the most confusion Elements of the Model The model consists of only three elements 1 Structure By structure I mean processes tools organization charts roles and responsibilities job definitions and grades concepts of operation budgets plans performance goals and objectives metrics systems and all the other documents and systems by which companies define the ways in which they expect to work 2 People By people I mean those who actually do the work of the organization 3 Issues By issues I mean problems opportunities risks red flags items with which people need help events that should stimulate action and situations that require decisions The Model Lean Model Diagram images a new model for lean culture jpg Traditional vs Lean Cultures The Traditional Approach In the traditional organization as depicted on the left side of the diagram the emphasis tends to fall first on the structure then on the people and finally on the issues This means that management is focused first on getting the right structures in place Next they train coach and motivate their people to conform to the structures And when issues occur they tend to treat these as unwelcome exceptions things that would not have occurred if people had only been doing a better job of following the established structures The Lean Approach In contrast issues are the first area of focus in a lean culture Issues are not treated as unwelcome exceptions they are expected as part of doing business So the organization is first focused on identifying the most important issues to be worked People are then trained coached and motivated to solve problems to analyze alternatives and to resolve issues Structure processes tools organizational models and all the rest of it are viewed as essential but as subservient to issues and to people changing as needed in responses to issues that arise and people s responses to those issues The Toyota Way as Seen through the Model If we arrange the 14 principles of The Toyota Way under the elements of the model they might appear as follows Note that to show what I consider to be the proper arrangement of two of the items I have added Philosophy at the top and Technology at the bottom Also note that while some of the principles reference two or more of the elements I have listed them under the elements that seem to play the primary role for example the idea of continuous process flow is listed under issues since the explicit purpose for such a structure is to bring problems to the surface Philosophy Base your management decisions on a long term philosophy even at the expense of short term goals Issues Create continuous process flow to bring problems to surface Use pull systems to avoid overproduction Build a culture of stopping to fix problems to get quality right the first time Use visual control so no problems are hidden Go and see for yourself to thoroughly understand the situation genchi genbutsu Make decisions slowly by consensus thoroughly considering all options implement decisions rapidly People Grow leaders who thoroughly understand the work live the philosophy and teach it to others Develop exceptional people and teams who follow your company s philosophy Respect your extended network of partners and suppliers by challenging them and helping them improve Become a learning organization through relentless reflection and continuous improvement Structure Standardized tasks are the foundation for continuous improvement and employee empowerment Level out the workload Technology Use only reliable thoroughly tested technology that serves your people and processes Based on the allocation shown above we can see that the order of precedence I am suggesting is supported by the numbers of items at each level as well as by the dependencies indicated by the principles themselves for example standardized tasks are the foundation for continuous improvement responding to issues and employee empowerment people Implications of the Model Any good model should help explain known phenomena so let s look at some of the common observations about differences in lean organizations and see how they relate to this model Attitudes Towards Process Phenomenon Other companies seem to struggle with Toyota workers acceptance of process standards For many traditional organizations it seems difficult to get their workers to take process seriously These companies sometimes respond to this issue by placing greater emphasis on process discipline but this often seems to result in a process backlash rather than acceptance of process standards by the workforce Explanation People sometimes mistakenly think that for Toyota and other lean companies process is paramount However as this model clearly shows process is an essential element but is subservient to both issues and people This means that processes change and evolve in response to new issues or to new answers to existing issues This also means that teams of workers are empowered to change processes when they demonstrate that they have found a better way For traditional organizations however processes are viewed as being first and foremost This means that the people either blindly accept the structures they are given or covertly resist them as being too rigid and arbitrary Waste vs Productivity Phenomenon When first introduced to the concept of waste and waste reduction many people used to working in traditional organizations seem to respond by saying Yes I understand this is the same thing as improving productivity We re already doing that Yet this response seems to miss the point Explanation For most organizations productivity improvement is a structural element part of a company initiative an annual goal or a required chart in a standard performance review Another way to say this is that productivity is a systematic way of measuring the results of waste reduction Waste on the other hand is an issue a specific way in which resources are being consumed without adding any value to a product or service This may sound like a simple semantic distinction but think of the resulting difference in the communication to people In a traditional organization a leader might set a productivity improvement goal then flow it down to teams and individuals you must improve your productivity this year by 4 In a lean culture the focus is on teaching employees to recognize waste and then to eliminate it or reduce it In this environment leaders focus their communications on helping employees to solve difficult problems to strengthen their own problem solving skills and to mentor others Stop the Line Phenomenon One of the most frequently cited elements of the Toyota Production System is the ability of any manufacturing worker to stop the assembly line when they recognize a significant product defect This practice is often difficult for other companies to accept or to understand let alone implement successfully Explanation The production line is an important element of structure it is an embodiment of the manufacturing process for product assembly In a lean culture since structure is subservient to issues and to people it is only natural for a worker to be able to stop the line when he or she spots a significant defect if the structure is producing defects then it needs to be stopped and changed and it is the responsibility of every employee to do this when appropriate In a traditional culture though since the structure of the production line has the highest priority it is difficult to accept that people have the power and responsibility to stop it no matter how significant the issue that has been discovered Shoot the Messenger Phenomenon Toyota is famous for the way that it deals with problems managers and engineers inspect the work and the product to help resolve issues and teams and organizations tend to take joint ownership of problems rather than to lay blame on particular individuals In more traditional cultures though those who bring bad news to leadership are often punished for doing so and even when they recognize that this sort of behavior is dysfunctional leaders in traditional organizations often seem powerless to behave differently Explanation In traditional organizations managers tend to think of themselves as responsible for laying out basic organizational structures and communicating these to their people If people later bring problems back to management then this is viewed in one of the following ways The problem resulted from employees failing to conform to the structures they were given which is indicative of either incompetence or willful disobedience The problem resulted from a problem with the structures laid down by management resulting in an implicit criticism of management In either case the natural response is to punish the messenger to motivate appropriate future behavior Kanban Phenomenon Before learning of Toyota s approach traditional manufacturers controlled work on the shop floor through the implementation of increasingly complex manufacturing resource planning systems Toyota demonstrated a better way however by using simple visual triggering systems employing cards or other simple devices to signal that supplies of a part had been exhausted and more needed to be built Explanation The natural tendency of a traditional organization is to create a complex highly structured system to control work People are then trained on how to use the system and when results are not as desired the system is improved or the people are given additional training to improve their conformance to the system The lean approach however is to recognize the need to build more parts as an issue rather than hiding issues as symptoms of failure the lean culture naturally accepts and highlights such issues so that people can respond to them appropriately Growth vs Decay Phenomenon Over the past seven decades the Toyota Corporation has grown from a small almost unknown Japanese company to a major international presence Even as it has opened its kimono and invited others to study and learn from its practices other companies have imitated its methods and tried to emulate its success but Toyota has continually outpaced its competitors and adapted successfully to new challenges as it has continued to grow Explanation The traditional model is essentially a steady state model in that it assumes that once the correct structures have been put in place conformance to structure is the only requirement for continued operation In this sense it is like any perpetual motion machine since it sooner or later succumbs to friction and entropy and loses energy until it ceases to function The lean model on the other hand is a dynamic model A steady stream of new issues is assumed and the people and the structures of the organization adapt and respond to these new issues as they emerge Adoption of External Standards Phenomenon Despite the fact that many standards have been created in order to instill and promote the very principles of quality on which Toyota has built its own Production System Toyota has repeatedly indicated that it has no interest in demonstrating conformance to these external standards including ISO 9000 Malcolm Baldrige CMMI and others Explanation Since traditional cultures place the highest priority on structures they often attempt to implement quality improvements by basing their own internal structures on some existing external structures such as these sorts of quality standards These sorts of quality programs often fail to bear long term fruit however In the case of lean culture though since an organization s structures are seen as evolving in response to their own people and issues and since they have no influence over external structures it makes no sense for them to seek to conform to these external standards Conclusion This new cultural model seems helpful in that it is simple intuitive and easy to grasp yet helps us to understand and explain the methods practices and ultimately the successful results already observed and documented to be associated with a lean organization such as Toyota s CMMI https en wikipedia org wiki CMMI ISO 9000 https en

them because they ve been useful But let s not confuse having a useful model with actual knowing > > Managers have a problem when they fall in love with a particular model of how something works When they become convinced that a mental model they have of how something works is the right one When they decide that they know something when we become too wedded to a model we lose our ability to deal

never was meant to be a replacement or a definition of anything in the real world That is what a model is Over the course of my career I ve had occasion to become acquainted with a number of different models that attempt to represent some aspects of business reality To name a few The Software Capability Maturity Model or CMM sw cmm The Capability Maturity Model Integration or CMMI Configuration Management II or CMII A Quality Management System or QMS as defined by ISO 9001 The Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award baldrige The Information Technology Infrastructure Library itil The Project Management Body of Knowledge or PMBOK <img src= images frankenstein jpg alt= Frankenstein Movie Poster title= class= pic right > And while all of these models have proven useful at times I have noticed that there is a disturbing tendency for all of these creations of ours to eventually grow beyond our original intentions to assume lives of their own and to eventually turn on their masters like Frankenstein s monster More specifically all such models seem to bring with them the following associated problems 1 They become more complex over time The original CMM was 437 pages long The CMMI for Development Second Edition now weighs in at 676 pages ITIL has grown in a similar fashion And while the increased size of these models makes them more comprehensive and complete and accurate one may well wonder in line with the characterizations of models above whether these attributes actually make them more useful As the character from <cite>The Adventures of an IT Leader< cite> says If it s complicated enough to be realistic it s too complicated to be useful 2 They tend to grow beyond their original scopes and exhibit megalomaniacal tendencies to represent all of reality as in the utopian quest for a unified field theory uft As examples the Quality movement gradually evolved to a comprehensive Quality Management System that encompasses almost every aspect of business management CMII has evolved to the point where it claims the ability to solve almost all business problems through the proper application of configuration management And the CMM originally conceived as a solution to the software crisis eventually grew into the CMMI a comprehensive maturity model for all forms of product and service development And ITIL initially a model for IT infrastructure management now has ambitions to describe all of Information Technology 3 They become authoritarian In order to motivate changes in behavior these models are often offered up as officially sanctioned documents or referred to as collections of industry best practices And while such efforts are well intentioned and are often helpful in that they can short circuit endless and ill informed internal debate such attitudes ultimately have the unhealthy effect of making these models seem like unquestionable authoritative bibles 4 They exert a hypnotic effect on their followers Because of their size and complexity many of these models seem to demand monk like devotion from those who would seek to understand them Because of their ambitions many of their followers seem to actually come to believe that they offer the complete and unadulterated Truth and not just a single necessarily imperfect view of reality And because they are used as authoritarian instruments their followers feel compelled to regard them as official versions of reality 5 They tend to encourage exclusivity Let s face it if you are going to invest enough time and effort to become reasonably well versed in a model that runs to over 500 pages in length then you are not likely to immediately put that aside and turn to the next model in order to study that No You are going to stick with what you know and try to get some return on your already sizable investment in the model you started with 6 They form the foundations for businesses of various sorts Authoring organizations begin to see their models and continuing improvements to these models and training on these models as revenue streams Authors and consultants spring up and see allegiance to these models as their retirement plans Vendors build products around these models and sell them to followers at annual conferences Businesses sink investments into these models and so become committed to them All of these various forms of financial incentives tend to exacerbate the other problems described here None of which is to suggest that we should avoid models altogether A well made model is a wondrous thing and a good one can help us to understand the world around us and provide helpful guidance for our actions But let s keep them off the pedestals and on their leashes please to remind us all which is the servant and which the master

reason This appreciation began for me when The Beatles burst upon the American musical scene in the early sixties Unlike most other musical artists of the era there was no separation between front man and backup band It was not Buddy Holly and the Crickets but simply The Beatles And radio DJs of the era often referred to them as John Paul George and Ringo rather than by the group s collective name

fact equals The Beatles Anthology later reported the tough decision John Lennon had to make when first forming the fledgling rock group > Was it better to have a guy who was better than the people I had in To make the group stronger or to let me be stronger Instead of going for an individual thing we went for the strongest format equals But did this mean that The Beatles were models of efficiency

thoughts on the nature of their group > Young Rick was insistent Why can t we have a band he asked where everybody plays an instrument everybody sings everybody does it without some guy out in front of the thing running the show and deciding the way things are gonna go This was a radical notion like communism But maybe I thought for the first time in our or anyone s imagination the rhythm section could run the band This same egalitarian collaborative spirit is present in jazz as well As Wynton Marsalis said in his book Moving to Higher Ground How Jazz Can Change Your Life marsalis > Jazz is the most flexible art form ever because it believes in the good taste of individuals It believes in our ability to make reasonable choices It takes a chance on our decision making skills instead of legislating our freedom away with written restrictions and restrictive hierarchies In jazz the size of your heart and your ability to play determine your position in the band The philosophy of jazz is rooted in the elevation and enrichment of people plain ol folks One of my greatest lessons in leadership came when hearing and seeing Miles Davis perform at Hill Auditorium in Ann Arbor in 1970 For what I remember most clearly today is not the playing of the great jazz trumpeter himself but the way he moved to the side of the stage between solos restlessly pacing in the shadows making way for this team of equals he had formed including some of the greatest talent of that or any era John McLaughlin Wayne Shorter Chick Corea Dave Holland Jack DeJohnette and Airto Moreira to collectively form the complex and challenging music that was taking shape as we all watched and listened And so as I ve grown over time from individual contributor to manager and moved from one assignment to the next I ve come to believe that my greatest contributions as a leader are to make sure that each team includes diverse voices that each of those voices has a chance to be heard that we avoid easy answers based on assumed consensus and that we all recognize that our collective wisdom is greater than the smarts of any one of us on our own In other words as the boss I try to always remember the hard

        content: "It occurred to me recently that there are really three essential functions of management Strategy setting a direction for your organization Alignment getting organizational resources lined up to execute the strategy Execution delivering expected results as part of the fulfillment of your strategy One might argue that there are many more functions of management but I think it is helpful to understand that these three are the primary and in fact essential functions and that all the other things managers do must be understood to support one or more of these three functions Let s take a look then at the essential nature of these three functions Strategy A strategy defines an approach for delivering superior value to your customers A strategy must answer the following questions Who are our future customers How can we provide them with greater value than they have today How can we provide them with greater value than that available from our competitors What is our approach What makes us think it will work What do we expect to achieve What resources will we need in order to execute the strategy If you don t have well researched and reasoned answers to all of the questions above then at best you have an incomplete strategy and at worst you have no strategy at all Note that an aspirational use of superlatives should not be confused with a strategy saying that you are going to be the greatest little xyz in the land is a nice sentiment but meaningless in the strategy department Strategies can and should exist at many levels of the organization so long as the strategies are consistent with one another Note though that each strategy must exist at the top of an organization so while it is fashionable in business today to say that leadership is everywhere and we are all leaders we should not all be setting strategy for if everyone is left to devise their own strategy then the the organization has no strategy at all Strategy requires a leader to look forward into the future since any successful strategy must anticipate emerging opportunities changes in customer demographics and desires and evolving capabilities of the competition We must also understand that strategies grow stale over time as business conditions change as new competitors emerge and as customer interests evolve If we understand strategy as described above then it should be clear that strategy is essential otherwise your organization is like a ship without a captain to set its course and such a ship is much more likely to founder upon the rocks than to reach any desirable destination Alignment Organizational alignment to the strategy is the necessary next step in achieving desirable results organizational resources in terms of dollars hours and energy must be focused on the various elements of your strategy In practice this usually means that expenditure of these scarce resources in other areas must stop in order to bring your strategy to fruition Alignment is the function that falls primarily on the shoulders of middle management in fact this is what we generally mean by middle management for these are the people who have strategy set above them and execution resources operating below them so it is their job to communicate the strategy and make sure that operational resources are working in alignment to those strategies It would be a mistake though to think that a particular level on an org chart is limited to performing a particular function For one it is often the role of top executives to help align those in the organization to a dramatic new strategy And it is often the case as well that it may fall to the shoulders of many levels of management to devise a strategy for success within their own corners of the organization one that is of course in alignment with higher level strategies In order to achieve alignment a manager must do all of the following Understand the strategy Communicate the strategy not just as handed down in stone from on high but by putting it into words and concepts meaningful to those receiving the communication Understand where resources are currently misaligned Take whatever means are necessary to bring resources into alignment with the strategy Note that alignment is often difficult and risky work As one example see this captivating YouTube video http youtu be FF tKLISfPE of Steve Jobs at the 1997 Apple World Wide Developers Convention working to bring Apple developers into alignment with the company s new strategy Or for that matter see this video http youtu be 4Dux4ugCoXM showing how Bo Schembechler brought his defensive captain onboard with his strategy for the 1980 Michigan football team Execution Once resources are aligned with the strategy then those resources must perform their particular organizational functions efficiently and effectively Unlike strategy which is forward looking execution requires a tactical focus on the people materials methods and tools at work in the current timeframe Some Useful Observations 1 If you are not seeing the results you would like in some part of your organization then it is worth asking whether the problems primarily stem from a flawed strategy lack of alignment to that strategy or to poor execution If your strategy is poor or if your resources are not aligned to your strategy then improved execution probably won t help 2 If you are unsure whether a certain decision has to do with elements of strategy then ask yourself whether that decision affects your resource allocation If a decision requires you to acquire or get rid of resources or to change the types of resources you are using or to reassign resources to a different statement of work then it is probably a decision that involves some elements of strategy 3 As a manager at any level of an organization you always need to maintain an awareness of which function you are being called upon to perform in any situation If a strategy has been set at a higher level then it is part of your job to align resources to that strategy or to convince your leadership that they should adopt a better strategy"

        content: "Some of the most troublesome topics in software development are those surrounding defects Why do defects happen How can we prevent them Can they be eliminated What metrics can we use to measure our success or lack thereof Let me introduce my thoughts on this topic with a little story When I started my career programmers were still using coding sheets that were sent to keypunch operators to be converted into punched cards The card decks were then sent to a mainframe to be compiled There were few if any defects introduced by the keypunch operators because at that time every punched card was independently verified by another operator who essentially re keyed every character on every line of every coding sheet So the first set of errors or defects that a programmer normally had to deal with were the syntax and spelling errors found by the compiler My programming group at that time had one member who was known for first time quality He performed extensive desk checks of his coding sheets before sending them to keypunch and as a result almost all of his programs sailed through the compilation step without generating any errors at all Of course if you ever went out to lunch with this guy you would discover that he never made a left hand turn but instead would invariably make three right hand turns because that way he never had to turn in front of oncoming traffic If I seem to be boring you with ancient personal history it s only because the simple story above illustrates most of the basic issues still surrounding software defects today 1 Humans will make errors 2 There are various types of errors that can be made 3 Many forms of defect prevention require an explicit inspection of the original work either by the original worker or by a peer 4 Automation should be used as much as possible to prevent as many types of errors as practical 5 The sooner an error can be detected and corrected the cheaper it will be to fix 6 There are trade offs to be made between the costs of prevention and the risks of failures risks should be reduced to a reasonable level but the costs of prevention should not become unreasonable in the process All of this sounds pretty straightforward and yet issues surrounding defects still seem to regularly generate lots of controversy in software development discussions Here are a few general recommendations 1 Use the Cost of Quality as a conceptual model Although it is not often practical to calculate such a cost with any precision the idea of trying to minimize the overall Cost of Quality http en wikipedia org wiki Quality costs is still a useful concept for consideration by teams and organizations Discussing test automation peer reviews and pair programming may prove controversial but people should be able to reach some common ground once they agree that the overall goal is to reduce the total cost of quality including both costs of appraisal and prevention as well as direct and indirect costs associated with software failures 2 Allow the development team to self manage defects that are contained within the team It is occasionally tempting for upper management or well intended governance bodies to try to mandate certain internal quality i e defect prevention practices and metrics across an entire software organization This may work well if all the teams are really doing very similar kinds of work on pieces of a unified product but in other situations such as many large and diverse IT organizations my strong sense is that such policies do more damage in terms of compromising each team s sense of autonomy than they do good It is easier to measure a team s performance in terms of productivity or cycle time than to try to make some meaningful sense of how each team internally deals with defect identification and correction 3 Do not confuse consideration of design alternatives with rework Many projects can benefit from some quick elaboration of design alternatives aka rapid prototyping in order to allow stakeholders to more meaningfully evaluate those alternatives Even though this may result in some work being thrown away none of this should be treated as work associated with the creation or correction of defects Such work is part of the cost of design not the cost of quality Unfortunately many agile teams simply treat consideration of design alternatives as something that is part and parcel of their iterative development process this is unfortunate because it then becomes difficult to disentangle team design and quality practices in any meaningful manner If you re in a situation where all software changes including correction of defects and changes in design are simply treated as more grist for the development team s backlog then you know you re in this situation and you should try to get out of it 4 Focus organizational attention on defects that impact others outside of the dev team Defects that escape from a dev team and cause negative impacts to others customers users integrated test teams etc should be rigorously measured and tracked and managed at an organizational level 5 Differentiate between varying severity levels All defects are not created equal Any sort of reporting and metrics systems should be sure to assign appropriate weights to defects based on their severity While wording may vary a scale similar to the following is often used 1 The system was rendered totally inoperable or unusable 2 A significant portion of the system was unavailable or unusable 3 The entire system was available and usable but with some significant degradation of performance or functionality 4 Problems were only cosmetic in nature 6 Perform causal analysis for quality escapes For software defects that escape into the wild it is useful to ask why they happened and what could have prevented them This sort of analysis is typically referred to as Root Cause Analysis http en wikipedia org wiki Root cause analysis however the focus should not be on coming up with a single root cause but with as many actionable causes as possible along with reasonable actions that will reduce the likelihood of recurrence of the same or similar problems in the future When performing this sort of causal analysis it may be useful to ask a more specialized variation of the usual Five Whys http en wikipedia org wiki 5 Whys that are typically invoked for this sort of work Why did the overall system service fail Which component s hardware network system software application software etc were at fault Why is this problem considered a defect Was it a sin of omission an error in the way a feature was implemented or an additional feature that was not requested What sorts of problems were noted Did the system crash or fail to operate at all Or did it run but with degraded performance Or were the problems functional rather than operational Why did the failure occur at this point in time Was it caused by a recent change to the software Or a recent change to the infrastructure Or a change in user processes and practices Were there integration issues between components In other words did the components appear to operate correctly when tested independently but fail when used in combination If so why weren t these integration issues identified and addressed earlier Were there unanticipated changes in functional or operational expectations for the software In other words did the requirements change without those responsible for the software knowing about the change If so then why weren t the changing requirements communicated Why weren t the defects discovered during testing If the defect occurred because of recent changes to the software then why was the defect introduced Was it injected during coding a coding error during design a design error or during requirements elicitation and definition a requirements error What would help prevent recurrence in the future Is further education needed Or additional reviews of code and or documents Are there automated tools that can help If you ask these questions and get some reasonable answers then you should be able to identify some meaningful actions to be taken to help prevent a recurrence of similar sorts of problems in the future 7 Make metrics simple and meaningful It would certainly be possible to create a comprehensive system of data collection and metrics reporting that would answer all possible questions about all defects found and corrected for any particular set of systems But the necessary level of effort might not actually provide any commensurate level of benefits Again my advice would be to make a clean separation between defects caught internally vs quality escapes For the former I would suggest that each development team be allowed to establish and track their own metrics For quality escapes my advice would be to use something like the GQM http en wikipedia org wiki GQM Goal Question Metric approach in order to provide focus for your metrics collection and reporting efforts In other words start with a goal or a small number of goals For each goal what sort of questions would you like to be able to answer to find out how you re doing on the way to meeting that goal And then what metrics will help you answer those questions The first programmers were able to blame their problems on actual insects crawling around inside their computing hardware these days however everyone knows that software bugs should not be treated as a branch of entomology How they should be treated however is often a topic of much debate Hopefully the comments above can help to steer such conversations into productive channels"

Harvard University Wynton Marsalis harvard pic This got me thinking about some of the notable messages from his and Geoffrey Ward s recent book <cite> Moving to Higher Ground How Jazz Can Change Your Life marsalis 2008 < cite> Dr Marsalis is a philosopher as well as a musician and in this book he and Ward have this to say about jazz and democracy > Jazz is the most flexible art form ever because it believes in the good taste of individuals It believes in our ability to make reasonable choices It takes a chance on our decision making skills instead of legislating our freedom away with written restrictions and restrictive hierarchies In jazz the size of your heart and your ability to play determine your position in the band The philosophy of jazz is rooted in the elevation and enrichment of people plain ol folks I mention all of this in a forum on software development because I think this same egalitarian spirit also runs through much of the Agile movement Just as jazz represents a shift away from large teams that require scores and conductors and rigid musical rules agile in some sense represents a movement away from the forced marches of large armies of developers working to exhaustive detailed project schedules Marsalis and Ward also emphasize the importance of group dynamics within the art form and I think this too reflects part of the underlying agile philosophy > Swing the dance and the music bespeaks the flexible nature of American life In jazz the bass walks a note on every beat The drummer rides the cymbal or plays brushes on every beat And everybody else invents melodies and sounds that sway with against and upside every beat Every beat requires musicians to reassess their relationships to one another This is what makes swinging so challenging You are forced to be constantly aware of other people s feelings Substitute the sprint or the daily meeting for the beat in the words above and they could easily be describing an agile software development team As a matter of fact if we change a few words in the <cite> Manifesto for Agile Software Development agile manifesto < cite> it could easily become <cite>The Jazz Manifesto< cite> <p style= text

But just as Marsalis emphasizes that there is an underlying philosophy and feeling for people that makes jazz work it s important to remember that agile is more than a set of practices and deliverables it also represents a set of beliefs about people the way they relate to their work and the ways they work best together So just as you could teach any musician the notes to A Love Supreme a love supreme but they still wouldn t be playing jazz it takes more than a different lifecycle and a new set of practices to make a successful transition to agile In particular I think jazz and agile both emphasize the following 1 The need for flexibility agility as a means of adapting quickly and responsively to a dynamic environment 2 That players practitioners developers as the people most directly shaping the output of the work being done have the most to contribute to improvements in their respective forms and deserve the highest respect for their work 3 That the work is inherently creative and cannot be managed as if is transactional 4 That the work is best done by interdependent teams in which all are dependent on each other for success 5 That teams will manage themselves to optimize their overall output in a way that makes best use of the various talents available on the team 6 That freedom of self expression is balanced by the judgments of fellow team members and the customer audience 7 The importance of the central discipline of a regular rhythm to the work being done 8 That the freedom to make mistakes combined with short feedback loops from teammates and customers are essential to learning and that this sort of learning will have a more positive long term influence on player practitioner behavior than sets of rigid rules and management hierarchies So

        content: " Originally published at PaganTuna com on 11 Feb 2012 I can still remember a time when the IT Director where I worked issued an edict stating that no further external memoranda would leave our department without his approval A statement like this sounds terribly ancient to us today at least partially because e mail and other forms of electronic communication have become so common that it is hard to imagine a time when the current overwhelming flow of written text could have been staunched by such a simple peremptory command Almost everyone I talk to today is suffering from e mail overload to one degree or another I know it s gotten bad when people tell me that they are pleasantly surprised to see that I actually respond to their e mails within a few hours It doesn t have to be that way The genie can be put back in the bottle and e mail can once again become a willing helpmeet rather than a rampaging monster All it takes is the discipline to follow the steps below Note that these tips involve all the various pieces of the e mail process My experience has been that it is only through this sort of systems thinking that the problem can be addressed Local solutions deleting everything in your inbox at the end of the week for example may bring temporary relief to one user in the short run but only adds to the overall problem in the larger view So here they are 15 steps to stopping the e mail madness 1 If you regularly receive e mail that is of no interest to you then let the sender know We sometimes fail to take this simple step for fear of offending the sender or for lack of time to make the request but in the long run it is much more offensive and time consuming to delete e mails without reading them than it is to ask the sender to remove you from a distribution list 2 Don t send an e mail too long to be entirely visible on a single screen If it s longer than this then there s a good chance that it won t be read in its entirety And even if it is there s a good chance it won t be effectively understood Use some other form of communication instead if you have that much material to convey 3 Never send an e mail without taking a few seconds to proofread it If it takes more than a few seconds to proofread then it s probably too long anyway see item 2 And if you don t think the e mail is important enough to proofread then odds are your potential readers will get the message that it s not important enough for them to actually read An important corollary is to always turn on your spelling checker and help it learn valid words that it may not initially recognize Taken together these steps will help to avoid e mails going out with obvious spelling errors that make your missive look more like a hastily assembled ransom note than a business communication worthy of the recipient s attention 4 Be selective about your target audience Before hitting the send button make sure you re not sending the e mail to a longer list than is really necessary Not only will you avoid wasting people s time the people you do send it to will be more likely to read it and respond productively if they can see that they re part of a select few recipients An important corollary of this rule of course is to never hit Reply to All if you can more productively limit your response to a smaller audience 5 Carefully distinguish between those who should be recipients vs those who only need to be copied Be aware that some people deal with their inbox by ignoring e mails on which they re only copied So be sure to include any folks from whom you expect some action in the primary addressee list and cc those who may be interested but don t have a definite need to know Making this distinction will also avoid potential confusion about who is actually expected to take some action as the result of your note 6 Avoid a scolding or hostile tone in your e mails You may have every right to be mad Your recipient may have been ignoring your e mails for over a week They may be delinquent in completing an important action They may have done something that you consider completely idiotic and misguided None of this matters If you have this sort of information and emotion to convey then it should be done face to face or over the phone Trying to scold people via e mail will only make them less likely to read and respond to your e mails in the future It s like telling your wayward dog to Come while waving a rolled up newspaper your mixed message is not likely to have the desired effect 7 If you ve discovered a contentious issue and failed to resolve it in the first couple of rounds of e mails and replies then schedule a meeting for further discussion Continuing to use e mail to address the issue at that point is only likely to drive the issue underground creating a festering sore that will worsen over time or further polarize your audience making the issue even less amenable to an amicable future resolution 8 Minimize use of e mail to provide information of enduring interest Information that people will want to refer to later should be stored on a Web site or wiki or some other served information repository The initial announcement of the availability of such information should be brief and contain a link to the ongoing location of the information Such practices avoid the waste of having all the recipients separately figuring out how to store the information for later reference and ensures that all consumers of the information are always referring to the latest version of the information 9 Choose a system for managing your incoming mail and implement it consistently There doesn t seem to be any one system that works for everyone Some people keep a separate archive with folders organized by topic for storing e mails they may later want to reference Others keep all their e mail forever in one big folder trusting to searching sorting and filtering tools to find a note of interest when necessary Some establish a sophisticated set of automated rules to help them sort and filter their incoming mail Any of these systems can work effectively so long as it matches your work style and so long as you use it consistently But whatever you do adopt some sort of system Letting the e mail pile up without reading or responding to it then whining about how much e mail you get is just lame 10 Never end your day with unread e mail Yes I know this sounds impossible for some of you And there will be days when this will be unrealistic But as a general rule this is a critical discipline If you ve got 10 e mails you can t find time to read today then you re likely to have 20 tomorrow and so on Before long perhaps while you re hosting an online meeting your coworkers will see the hundreds of unread e mails in your inbox and will realize that sending you further e mail is likely to be a pointless effort This may seem like a good thing until you realize that they are now going around you and over your head in order to get some needed action 11 Avoid touching any given e mail more than once If you are going to have any hope of dealing with all that e mail then you will need to find a way to do so efficiently And the most important rule here is that once you look at an e mail you should read it and decide what to do with it before moving on to anything else In many or most cases you should be able to simply delete the e mail after reading it In many other cases you can dash off a brief reply or forward it to someone else and then delete the e mail Other e mails may require more complex analysis or action and may need to wait until later Of course if you ve deleted the others then leaving these e mails in your inbox until you have time to deal with them is a low cost option Some people may prefer more complex systems for sorting and filing these or transferring them to some sort of task manager Again there are many viable options you just need to find one that works for you and apply it consistently By the way smart phones seem to exacerbate this problem since people frequently make time to check their inbox using such devices but often put off dealing with their e mails until they can get back to their full size screens and keyboards 12 Wait to reply Despite the advice above there are times when it is better to read a message now but wait until later to respond to it First if you are catching up on your incoming mail then you should generally wait to reply to a message until you have read following ones to see what others may have already contributed no sense in firing off a reply to an earlier message if the conversation has already progressed beyond that point Others may even have resolved the issue without your assistance which would be the best case scenario since the most efficient email is the one you never had to send and the one others never had to read Second if you don t yet have a definitive response it may be better to take time to collect further information or simply collect your thoughts or let others reply before sending your own words into the ether Finally if you re in a position of authority and a decision is called for you may want to wait to let others weigh in with information and opinions before you respond since your response may be viewed as the final word on the subject and so may forestall further discussion 13 Turn off instant notifications of new mail I suppose there must have been a moment in the history of the medium when the arrival of a new e mail message was so exciting that you couldn t bear to wait one second before learning of its presence in your inbox I think it s safe to say that this moment has now passed If you re still hearing little noises or seeing little pop ups every time you receive a new message then take a few minutes right now to find the option to turn it off You will make more efficient use of your time if you pick the moment when you want to read new mail rather than having the arrival of every message interrupt your train of thought while you re trying to focus on something else 14 Leverage E Mail s many strengths There are lots of things e mail is not very good at And it can certainly turn on you if you re not careful But e mail can be a great productivity enhancer when used correctly It s particularly good for carrying on multiple concurrent asynchronous conversations for maintaining a clear record of ongoing written dialogues and for quickly conveying written news as it becomes available 15 Avoid being boring This is a good recommendation for all written business communications but is certainly applicable to e mail If you want people to read what you have written then it helps to make it interesting Your subject matter will not always have people on the edge of their seats but with a little effort you can use humor enthusiasm and punchy direct language to maximize interest levels in your audience I don t expect people to save all of my e mails and mount them on the walls of their cubicles but I know some of my electronic missives that have achieved that honor and it s always a worthy goal to shoot for

        content: " Originally published at PaganTuna com on 07 Jun 2010 My first word processor was WordStar running on an Osborne computer Osborne sporting the CP M Operating System cpm Back in 1982 it seemed an amazing feat to be able to type a document format it save it to disk modify it and print it all with a computer sitting on my desktop Considering that the technology being replaced was a typewriter this was a brilliant leap forward Since that time of course computing technology has evolved considerably Computing networks the Internet the World Wide Web Google Wikipedia cloud computing PDAs smart phones tablet computers and more have all changed the way we think about computers and communication And yet somehow especially in business and organizational life the word processor and its output a stand alone textual document formatted for printing have survived to this day substantially unchanged with word processing and collections of words being treated essentially the same way they were thirty years ago Is this because such documents and the conventions of traditional word processors are still as useful as ever and continue to make modern businesses more productive No Quite to the contrary I will argue that such office documents are millstones around the necks of otherwise contemporary organizations quaint anachronisms whose continuing usage is dragging down productivity and gumming up the works of organizational life The Problems Here are the reasons why traditional word processors should be abandoned 1 Formatting a document for a single output device no longer makes much sense Back in 1982 when printing a document on a piece of paper was about the only useful way to share it with someone else formatting a document for printing was eminently practical But in today s world when a document might be published as a Web page a PDF document a chapter in an e book or a smart phone app it makes little sense for the specific details of margins typefaces font sizes paragraph justification and page breaks to be so visibly part of a document editing interface 2 The appearance of a document should be separated from its structure Directly manipulating the specific appearance of an individual chunk of text within a document is a terrible idea Authors should be focused on the content of their work not on the details of how each letter word heading or paragraph will be formatted in its final presentation And while tweaking the formatting details of a document until it looks just the way you want it may provide some satisfaction such embedded details make a document very difficult to maintain since all this formatting information needs to be individually re tweaked in order to make any significant changes in the overall appearance of the document 3 WYSIWYG is an idea whose time has come and gone One of the main features of modern word processors is an editing interface that presents the author with a visual representation of his document that appears very similar to the final output to be produced Such WYSIWYG interfaces What You See Is What You Get first became popular in the 1980 s and early nineties WYSIWYG seemed like a great idea when it first appeared because it allowed for a very intuitive graphical interface that freed the author from having to memorize a number of obscure formatting codes whose effects would only be apparent once the document was printed In today s world though WYSIWYG is increasingly meaningless since what you see will depend on what sort of device the document is ultimately viewed on and how the reader chooses to configure their document viewing software Further WYSIWYG encourages authors to obsess over formatting details as intrinsic elements of the documents they produce and actually hides the structural details of their documents since these structural details are typically implicit but not actually visible in the final output In other words a WYSIWYG interface runs exactly counter to points 1 and 2 above 4 Document file formats are needlessly bloated complex and obtuse I just opened a new document using a modern word processor entered the text Hello World and saved it to my hard drive The resulting document takes up 25k Since disk space is unbelievably cheap these days this might seem like no big deal but all that bloat implies needless complexity that makes it difficult to find other software that might do useful things to my document And so I am stuck with using the same software I used to create it or one of a few other pieces of software that seem remarkably similar when I want to do other things with or to my writings 5 Documents lack meaningful identifiers Documents are identified by their operating system file names Back in my WordStar days when I was saving a document onto a floppy disk that was probably sufficient But in today s world of ubiquitous networks superabundant disk storage and e mail it is woefully insufficient Let s say I save several different versions of my document And I save them in different folders And I save them with different names and naming conventions as the mood strikes me And I save them on a variety of file shares on a network And I e mail some of these versions of my document to different people at different times And the recipients of my e mails save my attached documents in various places and with various names And these same recipients also store my e mail with my document attached in various dark recesses of their mail filing system OK at this point where is my document Even more fundamentally what is my document Is it a single thing residing in various locations and at various version levels Or is each storage name and location a different document And when someone goes to use the document for whatever purpose it was originally intended what will they actually see Unfortunately when using a traditional word processor these are unanswerable questions 6 A document is an outdated concept One of the fundamental attributes of a document is that it is meant to stand alone to be relatively complete and self contained Another fundamental attribute of a document is that it is meant to be consumed in a linear fashion from front to back Both of these attributes make a lot of sense if you consider a document as something intended to be read from a series of printed pages But in today s digitized hyperlinked time sliced world these attributes seem increasingly dated I m going to print something out in order to read it Rather than read it on my laptop computer my tablet or my smart phone And I m going to read the entire thing through from front to back in one sitting Rather than going to the specific section I want just when I need it And this document is going to stand alone rather than being a smaller unit within a larger collection And I m going to consider this one document the last word on its particular subject and not hyperlink to or Google other sources while I m reading this one The answer to all these questions is increasingly the same Not bloody likely 7 Hyperlinks are fragile and difficult to maintain What if I want to create a link within my document so that an interested reader can view related material Of course using any modern word processor I can select a run of text in a document and attach a hyperlink to it And if I m linking to a Web page then this works reasonably well But what if I want to link to another document I created using the same software How do I identify the document I want to link to Only by using the file s disk location and file name both subject to all the same variations I described above which means that before long the link will probably stop working or take me to an out of date version of the document And when my links stop working how do I fix them since my word processing software gives me no way to manage these links other than viewing and editing them one by one Especially since the document file format is so peculiar and inscrutable that no other software exists that will let me manage my hyperlinks in any more meaningful way 8 Version Control vc is missing Almost all documents of any value change over time So it is natural to want to inspect a document s version history It is helpful when doing so to have some automatically maintained identifier that can be used to distinguish one version from another It is useful to be able to see when each version was created and by whom And of course it is sometimes vitally important to be able to determine what changed going from one version to another None of this is readily available from typical word processing software As a result entire corporations make decent profits selling expensive document management systems dms to other corporations partly in order to provide such basic version control functionality 9 Collaborative authoring is awkward at best Much of the meaningful work done today is increasingly team based No one person may be the authority on all aspects of a particular subject and a single document may need to include the expertise of several team members or may benefit from several sets of eyes having a chance to review and revise its content While some word processing software makes minor concessions to such a reality none of them fully embrace it so real document collaboration is still the exception rather than the rule 10 Documents don t work well with Web browsers Increasingly users open documents as a result of following links from other documents or from Web pages Unfortunately when a user has to open a document from a Web browser or even worse ends up opening a series of documents navigation proves tedious and confusing going something like this Click on a link Wait for word processing software to load Respond to a dialog box asking if you want to open the document or save it to your hard drive View the document using your word processing software Possibly click on other links perhaps opening other types of office software Now try to find a way back to the place that you started from At some point deal with all of these applications and windows that are now still open even though you are no longer using them The Defense Let me deal with some potential objections to my arguments at this point Some readers may suspect that I ve overstated my case After all word processing software has continued to grow and evolve over the years and in many respects has made attempts to address many of the issues listed above Is the situation really as bad as all that Well first of all let me admit that word processing software still has one pretty good use case production of papers for publication in academic journals This is a relatively isolated backwater of document production that has not changed appreciably over the years and word processing software is still a good fit for this particular task Unfortunately this may be a significant contributing factor to the software s broader popularity since it is after all the academics who teach the courses in which students learn to write class papers using this same software Other than that though all of my experience bears out the theoretical criticisms listed above I ve seen people struggle time and time again from the problems I ve identified and recent additions to word processing software and extensions of the document production model seem to be like the proverbial lipstick on the porcine barnyard animal doing little if anything to address the underlying issues As a matter of fact in many ways I think I ve understated the problem since other types of office documents such as presentations spreadsheets and e mail messages suffer from many of these same problems Even worse as makers of these traditional software packages have moved into groupware they have carried many of these same problems with them into what would otherwise be a new space The Alternatives So now what If the stuff we ve been using is no good what do we do now Throw it all out and start over Luckily that s not necessary Because as organizations have continued using traditional software a whole new set of tools have emerged and evolved and are perfectly capable of solving all the problems above when taken together All businesses need to do is to use them more extensively Here are the tools that solve the problems above 1 Hypertext Markup Language html HTML This is the basic language understood by Web browsers HTML has a nice clean document structure and a single HTML document can be easily output to multiple device types Users can typically choose from a number of available browsers and can configure their browser as it suits them adjusting things like font sizes and window sizes to their liking HTML files are small simple and relatively easy for mere mortals to understand Hyperlinks are an innate part of the language rather than being bolted on as an afterthought And a whole host of HTML editing tools and assistants are available to choose from 2 Cascading Style Sheets css CSS A CSS file encapsulates all of the desired formatting information into a separate compact simple file that can be shared across a whole set of documents Many different CSS editing tools are available 3 Uniform Resource Identifiers uri URIs and Universal Resource Locators url URLs These strings of characters are used to identify Web pages and other resources with each such resource being assigned a unique identifier 4 Web Sites A Web site offers a set of related pages as an alternative to a stand alone document Such an organizational scheme offers a relatively flat networked structure that allows a user to access what they need when they need it rather than forcing her to navigate through all the content in a linear fashion 5 Lightweight Markup Languages lightweight HTML is relatively simple especially when using it for document composition but the recent appearance of languages such as Markdown and Textile have made it even easier and more natural for authors to create documents in HTML This blog post for example was composed using Markdown 6 Version Control systems Version Control software is relatively available inexpensive and easy to use for plain text files such as those used to store HTML and CSS And version control is often available as a baked in function of web content management systems including wikis 7 Web Content Management Systems wcms WCMS Many such systems have emerged over the last few years including several good open source solutions Such systems make it relatively easy to organize serve and administer Web sites of any size typically incorporating all of the items above HTML CSS URLs URIs lightweight markup and version control Such systems also help to separate the duties associated with Web site creation allowing content contributors to do so easily while shielding them from associated complexities having to do with administration and look and feel issues 8 Wikis A wiki is a particular type of Web content management system with a particular focus on the ease and speed of content creation and organization Wikis also make it easy to author content collaboratively and reduce the risk of errors or vandalism since any past version of any page can be easily restored The extraordinary success of Wikipedia has given many people the impression that wikis are used solely for encyclopedias but wiki software can be used to create any sort of Web or intranet site In Summary So that s it There are still good reasons to use word processing software when creating legal documents or preparing printed materials But for the great majority of informal written communication within large organizations there are much better choices available today that can help improve productivity and decrease the possibilities of errors due to miscommunication All it will take to realize these gains is for office workers of the world to unite throw off the chains of their anachronistic word processing packages and enter the modern age of Web publishing The author in addition to using a typewriter and WordStar has prepared text for print using a combination of

        summary: "<blockquote>\n\n<p>Perfectionism (noun) &#8211; a disposition to regard anything short of perfection as unacceptable. </p>\n</blockquote>\n", 
        content: "> Perfectionism noun a disposition to regard anything short of perfection as unacceptable I find it peculiar that so many of the articles about Steve Jobs following his death have used the term perfectionism to describe one of his key traits as if this were a bad thing For example Perfectionism is the disease that plagued Jobs from a piece in The Atlantic Wire http www theatlanticwire com technology 2011 11 crazy perfectionism drove steve jobs 44623 Really I wonder what the more desirable healthy state might be And what sort of slogans might these anti perfectionists choose for their endeavors > A relentless pursuit of mediocrity > About what you would expect or a little bit less > Not great but good enough for the likes of you Any modern computing device is a complex integrated system based on millions of human design decisions whose quality is based not just on the accumulation of all of those individual judgments but also on the complex interplay between them And in order to be anything other than very expensive failures these products must be joyfully purchased and used by millions of consumers all over the globe Given all of this complexity and opportunities for error and poor design and business failure would you really want to strive for something less than perfection Granted perfection can never be achieved given the difficulty of the problems involved But isn t that all the more reason why we should be setting our sights at this level If we start with the intent to achieve something less than perfection and are content to accept work that is obviously less than perfect then what sort of end results can we expect Commentators complain that Jobs even let this crazy perfectionism spill over outside the boundaries of his professional career and into his personal life In the same Atlantic Wire piece for example the following story about the selection of a new washing machine is offered as proof of his derangement > We spent some time in our family talking about what s the trade off we want to make We ended up talking a lot about design but also about the values of our family Did we care most about getting our wash done in an hour versus an hour and a half Or did we care most about our clothes feeling really soft and lasting longer Did we care about using a quarter of the water We spent about two weeks talking about this every night at the dinner table Wow What a nut job Can you imagine A guy who runs the most successful consumer products company on the planet and he thinks it worth spending his evenings talking to his wife and kids about the design trade offs of a washing machine before buying one Sheesh It s only a washing machine Why can t he drink beer and watch football when he s not working like the rest of us Come off it Let s get real What are the possible reasons for not being a perfectionist 1 You can t tell which end is up anyway 2 You really don t give a hoot 3 You re much more interested in fitting in than in standing out 4 You consider your brain to be an organ only slightly less superfluous than your tonsils and your gall bladder I think I detect a certain degree of intellectual dishonesty in these criticisms of Jobs I have read many of these articles carefully and found no spelling errors no grammatical gaffes Could it be that these authors are themselves suffering from bouts of niggling perfectionism Are these the sorts of people who might complain about spelling errors found in others work even after coming home from a hard day at the office In short might we find well worn copies of <cite> Eats Shoots Leaves https www amazon com gp product 1592400876 ref=as li ss tl < cite> at home in their closets In the same <cite>Atlantic Wire< cite> piece another sign of Jobs disease is offered up as a quote from a Malcolm Gladwell piece itself based on the new Isaacson biography https www amazon com gp product 1451648537 ref=as li ss tl > He arrives at his hotel suite in New York for press interviews and decides at 10 P M that the piano needs to be repositioned Hold on here a minute This is not like you or me checking in to the Holiday Inn This is the CEO of Apple taking a no doubt very expensive suite not just so he has a place to sleep but to have a suitable setting where he can meet with members of the media to talk about Apple s latest products known for their elegant design What is so unreasonable about his wanting to arrange the room to make a suitable visual impact on his influential guests If we were writing about a concert pianist and he discovered at 10 P M that the piano in his suite was out of tune and he was going to play on that instrument in front of the press the next morning would his complaint be viewed as a sign of dysfunction I think there are two truths here that say more about our culture than they do about Steve Jobs 1 We tend to evaluate perfectionism as a social trait rather than as a business value As a social trait of course it can be annoying even though as a business value it can be critical to an organization s success 2 We tend to use perfectionism as a derogatory term when someone else cares more about certain values than we do or than we think they ought to If we re the sort of person who is frequently unsure about spelling for example and let our word processing software correct our mistakes then we will probably call our boss a perfectionist if he or she points out the spelling errors in our work If we re a software developer writing documentation for internal use then this sort of sensitivity to spelling errors may be inappropriate But if we re writing copy for a marketing piece for our company s new product then such sensitivity to spelling errors is a business necessity The truth is that Steve Jobs had a refined design sense that made him sensitive to the slightest issues things that the rest of us might not notice at first things that we might not be able to quite put our fingers on but things that ultimately and in accumulation would cause us to be less than satisfied with a product I for one am thankful for the perfectionism that pervades Apple every time I power up one of its products I m grateful for all the little touches and all the grand design concepts that reflect the seemingly infinite thoughtfulness and care that go into each of their works Perfectionism may be a demanding pursuit but when it comes to getting the important things right it sure beats all the alternatives that I ve seen"

        content: " Originally published at PaganTuna com on 12 Jun 2009 Entrepreneurs sometimes get a bad rap Anybody recognize this gentleman images adamosborne jpg A few years before the iPod he developed and marketed a portable computer about the size and heft of a sewing machine and sold it under his own name It ran what was then the most popular operating system for home computers http en wikipedia org wiki CP M and came with a slew of software including a Basic compiler from what was then a relatively small startup in the great Northwest http www microsoft com The Osborne 1 images osborne1 jpg It was a revolutionary computer in many ways and achieved some notable short term success However its creator never made any money from it and it was driven out of business by its competitors in a few years which is why the guy who marketed that pre Visual Basic compiler http en wikipedia org wiki Bill Gates is now a lot better known than Adam Osborne This is our usual image of the entrepreneur the restless loner always willing to risk it all on one more roll of the dice one last long shot one final chance to grab the golden ring I stumbled across a wonderful book recently <cite> The Empowered Manager Positive Political Skills at Work < cite> by Peter Block and in it he talks about choosing the entrepreneurial path over the bureaucratic path when working within large organizations Block tells a wonderful story of himself working as a young consultant trying to help a regional chain of supermarkets compete successfully in a changing marketplace The approach they took was to grant more power to the lower levels of the organization to encourage individual store managers to take more personal responsibility for the success of their stores The story is an amusing one They start with the store managers launch a change campaign at their level and meet with limited success When they meet with the store managers to find out what is going on they complain of resistance from the next level up Alright The team regroups designs a new change campaign to focus on the regional managers and after considerable further investment of time and money they discover that this campaign too has had disappointing results They meet with the regional managers interview them to discover the impediments to change and guess what they re not the problem it s their managers You can probably get a sense of where this is going Sure enough Block finally ends up in the office of the president of the corporation His narrative here is too good to let it suffer from my attempts to paraphrase > I was especially eager for this meeting since it would be my first real opportunity to deal directly on an intimate basis with the person in the seat of power in a major corporation If change had to come from the top I was meeting with the right person > > The meeting was scheduled and I arrived eager and dressed in my newly pressed power suit After a little light chatter about the weather and the ball scores I mentioned that the purpose of this meeting was to talk about how he could personally support the change effort we were engaged in He said he had met with the chairman of the board of directors earlier that morning and the chairman brought up a series of minor issues that were a real nuisance to have to deal with I suggested perhaps that Hilliard the president could support our program by personally getting out in the stores more Hilliard said that the chairman was not giving him all the support he needed I urged that Hilliard could perhaps allow certain merchandising decisions to be made at the district level instead of at the headquarters office in Somverville Massachusetts He said he was also having a hard time with certain analysts on Wall Street They refused to acknowledge the progress the new management was making and the stock price remained depressed I suggested we might hold a team building session with the top thirty people He stated that not only were the chairman of the board and the bankers giving him a hard time but he was frustrated with the ketchup in the company cafeteria > > It was at this point that I began to recognize that the conversation was not going the way that I had anticipated I asked him to tell me a little more about the ketchup in the company cafeteria He said it was too thin and watery I acknowledged that watery ketchup could be deeply disappointing thinking to myself that I had just stepped onto the set of a Woody Allen movie Hilliard began to get a little irritated with me and claimed I did not understand the point he was making He was right I noticed that he was wearing shoes with a clay colored tint to them He explained that the ketchup in the company cafeteria was a Finast private label brand and two weeks ago he had suggested that the product needed to be thickened to compete effectively with the name brand products He was constantly amazed at the effort it took to bring about even the smallest change in this old line company He thought that at least someone could have thickened the ketchup at his table in the company cafeteria even if the product on the shelves remained watery > > I was stunned I had thought that the president of a company could have it any way he or she wanted it I had pursued the source of power all the way up the organization and here the chief executive officer was telling me he was caught in the middle like the rest of us Block s experience mirrors my own When I talk to employees about making their software development more lean and agile they often tell me that they would love to but their bosses won t let them or their management won t buy them the tools they need to make it possible When I talk to people trying to promote internal standards they often suggest we ask our corporate leaders to issue an official edict that will force people to follow the standards And when I talk to leaders they often ask for suggestions on how we can get people to follow the guidance that has already been dispensed So who has the power to make change happen inside of large organizations The truth of course is that 1 None of us has absolute power no matter what our title 2 All of us have some power 3 All of us operate within certain constraints 4 None of us are absolutely certain of how much power we have 5 There is always a degree or risk involved with exercising our power So where does that leave us Block says that all of us have essentially three choices to make that determine to what degree we will be entrepreneurial rather than bureaucratic > We choose between Maintenance and Greatness > We choose between Caution and Courage > We choose between Dependency and Autonomy I had the privilege of having lunch yesterday with a group of corporate entrepreneurs This is a group that has been working together to create and deliver an internal course on Agile software development Five years ago when some of them started employing Agile at work they had to fly under the corporate radar in order to get started This year Agile has been officially recognized as something management would like to see more of with the result that some members of the group now have people calling them to ask if they can get credit for being Agile without really having to do anything different At no time during our lunch did I hear anyone use the words Greatness Courage or Autonomy And yet over and over again as we ate and chatted and talked about their Agile accomplishments I heard the same themes they were not content to keep doing the same things over and over again they were excited to try something new that would make them and their teammates more effective they were willing to take reasonable risks they were willing to act independently while still taking full responsibility for their actions More and more as I engage in discussions about what it takes to change corporate culture it seems to me that this is often the key issue how many of us are willing to stand up and say these magic words The watery ketchup stops here"
