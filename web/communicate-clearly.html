<h3 id="communicate-clearly">No. 12 &#8211;  Communicate Clearly</h3>



<p>The speed, efficiency and effectiveness of communication is all-important on a software development effort of any significant size. </p>

<p>Consider the following factors: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Signal-to-noise ratio: this is the ratio of useful information to the overall volume of information in a particular communication, or communication channel. Many developers, for example, find their incoming e-mail to have such a low percentage of signal that they abandon it altogether, except when pressed to dredge some particular nugget up out of the sea of dreck that is their inbox. </p>

<p>So make sure that your team communications are rich with important information, and light on administrivia and management-speak. </p></li>
<li><p>Warmth of communication types: As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alistair_Cockburn" class="reflink" target="ref">Alistair Cockburn</a> pointed out in his <cite>Agile Software Development</cite> Chapter 3 excerpt on &#8220;<a href="communicating-cooperating-teams.html" class="wiki-link">Communicating, cooperating teams</a>,&#8221; the effectiveness of communication generally increases as the warmth of the communication method increases, where two people working together at a whiteboard is at the warm end, and a number of people exchanging written information via pieces of paper is at the cool end of the spectrum. </p>

<p>It&#8217;s best to use warmer methods for the most critical exchanges of information. </p></li>
<li><p>Customer communication: be sure to communicate regularly and proactively with your key project stakeholders, to avoid any surprises or misunderstandings. For more on this topic, see the Pagan Tuna post, &#8220;<a href="customer-communication.html" class="wiki-link">Customer Communication</a>&#8221;. </p></li>
<li><p>Document formats: Lightweight markup languages such as <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" class="reflink" target="ref">Markdown</a> and Web content management systems such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki" class="reflink" target="ref">wikis</a> offer significant advantages over the usual word processing alternatives. For more on this topic, see the Pagan Tuna post,  &#8220;<a href="ten-reasons-to-ditch-your-word-documents.html" class="wiki-link">Ten Reasons to Ditch Your Word Documents</a>&#8221;. </p></li>
<li><p>Storage and retrieval of project documents: many projects rely on PowerPoint presentations stored in multiple places, exchanged via e-mail, with no easy way to find the latest version of a particular piece of information when you need it. Instead, try to emulate a site like Wikipedia. For more on this topic, see the Pagan Tuna post,  &#8220;<a href="lessons-we-should-have-learned-from-the-web.html" class="wiki-link">Lessons We (Should) Have Learned from the Web</a>.&#8221; </p></li>
<li><p>Effective use of E-mail: this can be an effective means of communication, but it is often used poorly. For more on this topic, see the Pagan Tuna post &#8220;<a href="taming-the-e-mail-monster.html" class="wiki-link">Taming the Eâ€“mail Monster</a>.&#8221; </p></li>
