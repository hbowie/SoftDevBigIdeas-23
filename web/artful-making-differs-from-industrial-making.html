<h5 id="artful-making-differs-from-industrial-making">12.5.1.1 Artful making differs from industrial making</h5>

But, as we shall see, industrial methods can distort reality and smother innovation. Artful and industrial making are distinct approaches and each must be applied in the appropriate conditions. </p>
