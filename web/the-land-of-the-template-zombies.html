<h5 id="the-land-of-the-template-zombies">12.31.1.1 The land of the template zombies</h5>


<p>When you find a project team that is focused on producing a standard document rather than on considering the content of that document, then you are in the land of the template zombies&#8230;. </p>

<p>In the land of the template zombies, form takes precedence. It is not necessary to think about the content of the document. It is not really necessary to think at all. The important thing is to have something &#8211; anything &#8211; under each of the prescribed headings. Not surprisingly, template zombies are adept in the art of cutting and pasting and ignoring anything that does not fit the dictates of the template. </p>
