<blockquote>
<p>We need to adopt the attitude that the internal structure of a system will require continuous improvement as the system evolves. Refactoring &#8212; improving the design as the system develops &#8212; is not just for commercial software. Without continuous improvement, any software system will suffer. Internal structures will become calcified and fragile. In a surprisingly short time, the system will cease to be useful. </p>
