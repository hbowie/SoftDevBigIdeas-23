<blockquote>
<p>Requirements are hard to understand and harder to specify. The wrong solution to this problem is to do a slipshod job of requirements specification, and rush ahead to design and code&#8230;. The right solution is to do whatever it takes to learn as many of the requirements as possible <em>now</em>. Do prototyping. Talk with more customers. Work for a month with a customer to get to know his or her job firsthand. Collect data. Do whatever it takes. </p>
