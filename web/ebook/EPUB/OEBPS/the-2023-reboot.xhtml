<p>In the spring of '23 I made some significant improvements to the site. </p>

<p>The content itself changed very little, but I&#8217;ve improved the overall organization, appearance and usability, and made some navigational enhancements. </p>

<p>Also, where I had been sometimes referencing my own content at PaganTuna.com, I&#8217;ve now pulled those referenced posts into a separate section at the back of this work. </p>

<p>Perhaps my favorite improvement is the new ability to consult one of the 52 big ideas <a href="random-idea.html" class="wiki-link">at random</a>; I can envision this being used in a somewhat oracular fashion, much as one might <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching_divination" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consult the I Ching</a>; or, in perhaps a less fanciful vision, as something to be exercised as part of a weekly staff meeting. </p>

<p>However you choose to use this content, though, I hope that these changes will make the site easier and more enjoyable to use. </p>
