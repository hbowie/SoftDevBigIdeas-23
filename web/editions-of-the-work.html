<p><em>The Big Ideas in Software Development</em> is a book, in the sense that it is: </p>

<ul>
<li>a written work, </li>
<li>of significant length, </li>
<li>focused on a particular topic, </li>
<li>of some enduring interest and relevance, </li>
<li>organized into the usual parts found in a book: introduction, sections, chapters, bibliography, index, and so on . </li>
</ul>

<p>However, unlike most books, this one is meant to take full advantage of the open web, and so is not offered exclusively, or even primarily, in the traditional printed form. </p>

<p>The book is authored using Markdown and Notenik, and all of the source files can be found on GitHub, at: </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hbowie/SoftDevBigIdeas-23" class="ext-link">hbowie/SoftDevBigIdeas-23</a> </li>
</ul>

<p>So, if you are using a Mac, the first way to read the book is to install Notenik, download the repository on GitHub, then open the <code>content</code> folder within Notenik. There is no cost for either the app or the book&#8217;s content, and Notenik is designed to make usage of the book in this form easy and pleasurable. </p>

<p>However, for most readers, the most convenient means of access will be to point their web browsers at <a href="https://www.softdevbigideas.com" class="ext-link">SoftDevBigIdeas.com</a>. </p>
