<p>Part of the key to any successful software development effort is to achieve an appropriate degree of generalization in the design. </p>

<p>As a developer considers different expectations and desires for the software&#8217;s behavior, the potential complexity of the software starts to escalate rapidly. </p>

<p>To counteract this growing complexity, the developer must look for similar patterns in these expectations, and then generalize the software around these patterns, rather than trying to instantiate every possible variation in users&#8217; desires and expectations. </p>

<figure class="notenik-quote-attrib"><blockquote><p>Simplicity goes beyond a term like &#8216;good user interface,&#8217; which has become so broad, it has little clear meaning. Simplicity is a goal with precision. <em>Simplicity</em> means streamlining, pruning clutter, cleaning up presentation, and improving the initial experience with a product. But Simplicity is more than just making a cute product for technophobes. Simplicity streamlines and optimizes use, as well. </p></blockquote><figcaption><p>&#8211; <a href="jenson-scott.html" class="wiki-link">Scott Jenson</a>, <em><a href="the-simplicity-shift-innovative-design-tactics-in-a-corporate-world.html" class="wiki-link">The Simplicity Shift:  <br>Innovative Design Tactics in a Corporate  <br>World</a></em>, 2002 </p></figcaption></figure>
