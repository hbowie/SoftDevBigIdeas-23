<h5 id="abeautifulsolutionthatworks">11.54.4.1 A beautiful solution that works</h5>



<p>When you start looking at a problem and it seems really simple, you don&#8217;t really understand the complexity of the problem. Then you get into the problem, and you see that it&#8217;s really complicated, and you come up with all these convoluted solutions. That&#8217;s sort of the middle, and that&#8217;s where most people stop&#8230;. But the really great person will keep on going and find the key, the underlying principle of the problem &#8211; and come up with an elegant, really beautiful solution that works. That&#8217;s what we wanted to do with Mac. </p>
