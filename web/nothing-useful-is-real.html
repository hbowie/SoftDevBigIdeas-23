<h5 id="nothing-useful-is-real">12.7.1.1 Nothing Useful is Real</h5>



<p>&#8230;you said you think you know some things. What you mean is, you&#8217;ve constructed simplified representations of how those things work. But don&#8217;t confuse yourself by thinking your simplified mental constructions are realistic, or worse yet, true &#8230; Nothing useful is real. If it&#8217;s complicated enough to be realistic, it&#8217;s too complicated to be useful. That&#8217;s why we build models. Representations. When we say we know things, we just mean we have mental models of those things that we like. Often we like them because they&#8217;ve been useful. But let&#8217;s not confuse having a useful model with actual knowing. </p>

<p>Managers have a problem &#8230; when they fall in love with a particular model of how something works. When they become convinced that a mental model they have of how something works is the right one. When they decide that they know something. &#8230; when we become too wedded to a model, we lose our ability to deal with new situations. </p>
