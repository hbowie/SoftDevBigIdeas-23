<h5 id="simplicity-of-software">12.53.1.1 Simplicity of Software</h5>


<p>Simplicity goes beyond a term like &#8216;good user interface,&#8217; which has become so broad, it has little clear meaning. Simplicity is a goal with precision. <em>Simplicity</em> means streamlining, pruning clutter, cleaning up presentation, and improving the initial experience with a product. But Simplicity is more than just making a cute product for technophobes. Simplicity streamlines and optimizes use, as well. </p>
