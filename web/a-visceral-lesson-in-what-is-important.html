<blockquote>
<p>While developing Toyota&#8217;s successful 2003 Sienna, the Sienna CE [Chief Engineer] drove his team in Toyota&#8217;s previous minivan model more than 50,000 miles across North America through every part of Canada, the United States and Mexico. The CE experienced a visceral lesson in what is important to the North American minivan driver and discovered in every locale new opportunities for improving the current product. </p>
