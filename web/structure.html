<p>The next section contains <a href="pagan-tuna-posts.html" class="wiki-link">Pagan Tuna Posts</a>. These are short pieces that go into detail on one topic or another, and are referenced from the appropriate <em>Big Idea(s)</em>. These were originally published on a blog written by the same author,  appearing at PaganTuna.com. Consult these as interests and needs dictate. </p>

<p>The <a href="reference.html" class="wiki-link">Reference</a> section contains info about the author, a glossary and a colophon. </p>

<p>This is followed by a section called <a href="finding-stuff.html" class="wiki-link">Finding Stuff</a>, which contains a number of pages providing various ways of finding particular items of interest and navigating to them. </p>

<p>The final secion is the <a href="bibliography.html" class="wiki-link">Bibliography</a>, which is quite extensive, and so is placed at the very end of the work so as not to obscure other contnet by its sheer bulk. </p>
