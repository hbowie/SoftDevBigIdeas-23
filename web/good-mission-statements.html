<h5 id="good-mission-statements">12.65.1.1 Good mission statements</h5>


<p>Good missions, and Mission Statements, exclude alternatives. Useless ones try to express everything you might ever want to do. </p>

<p>“We develop or install high-quality software” has no place in a Mission Statement, for example, because what other choice might you have expressed? The alternatives: </p>

<ul>
<li>We develop or install mediocre software. </li>
<li>We develop or install awful software. </li>
<li>We refuse to develop or install any kind of software. </li>
<li>We’d really like to develop and install software, only we’ve forgotten how. </li>
</ul>

<p>All are non-starters. Because the only statement you can make about software is that it will be high quality, don’t waste the paper and toner. </p>
