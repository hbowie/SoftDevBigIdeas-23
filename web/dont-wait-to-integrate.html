<h3 id="dontwaittointegrate">No. 46 â€”  Don't Wait to Integrate</h3>



<p>Although developers can and should decompose large problems into a series of smaller ones, at some point they must integrate everything back into a single working whole. </p>

<p>Some experts recommend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Continuous Integration</a> (CI), but at the very least we can say that development teams should integrate sooner rather than later. </p>

<p>Integration should include an integrated build of the entire system, and also testing of the integrated whole. </p>

<p>Integration of a system&#8217;s components is an example of the &#8220;check&#8221; step in the <a href="plan-do-check-act.html" class="wiki-link">Plan-Do-Check-Act</a> cycle, and Continuous Integration (or something close to this extreme) should be considered an example of <a href="shorten-feedback-loops.html" class="wiki-link">shortening your feedback loops</a> and <a href="make-problems-visible.html" class="wiki-link">making problems visible</a>. </p>

<p>Projects that defer integration until late in their efforts almost always run into problems, and very often those problems are large enough to cause the project&#8217;s implementation to be delayed, if not canceled altogether. </p>
